@realDonaldTrump	Do you think itâ€™s just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œKim Jong Un says North Korea will not make or test nuclear weapons, or give them to others - & he is ready to meet President Trump anytime.â€ PBS News Hour. I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea possesses great economic potential!
@realDonaldTrump	Washington Examiner - â€œMAGA list: 205 â€˜historic resultsâ€™ help Trump make case for 2020 re-election.â€  True!
@realDonaldTrump	Gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. This would be good!
@realDonaldTrump	Border Security and the Wall â€œthingâ€ and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Letâ€™s make a deal?
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to President 
@realDonaldTrump	One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œGeneralâ€ McChrystal got fired like a dog by Obama. Last assignment a total bust. Known for big, dumb mouth. Hillary lover! https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/1079824312708808710Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	Happy New Year!
@realDonaldTrump	HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA! 2019 WILL BE A FANTASTIC YEAR FOR THOSE NOT SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. JUST CALM DOWN AND ENJOY THE RIDE, GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY!
@realDonaldTrump	Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a very good and talented guy, has a great new book just out, â€œWhy We Fight.â€ Lots of insight - Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	...Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall. You see, without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech â€œstuffâ€ is just, by comparison, meaningless bells & whistles...
@realDonaldTrump	MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico & Canada will also thrive - good for all!
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!
@realDonaldTrump	Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didnâ€™t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country, but canâ€™t because Dems are blocking them, some for two years-historic record. Passed committees, but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!
@realDonaldTrump	The RNC has a great Chairwoman in Ronna McDaniel and the @GOP has never been stronger. We achieved historic wins with her help last year! #MAGAðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
@realDonaldTrump	The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!
@realDonaldTrump	The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they canâ€™t win based on all of the achievements of â€œTrump,â€ so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œMAGA list: 205 â€˜historic resultsâ€™ help Trump make case for 2020 re-electionâ€ https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/maga-list-205-historic-results-help-trump-make-case-for-2020-reelectionÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Sadly, there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	...I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Letâ€™s get it done!
@realDonaldTrump	Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people â€“ this is the first and most important duty of government...
@realDonaldTrump	The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. Iâ€™m sure he is a fine man, but I donâ€™t know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œJob growth surges by 312,000 in Decemberâ€ https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/04/nonfarm-payrolls-december-2018.htmlÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!
@realDonaldTrump	How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?
@realDonaldTrump	As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they canâ€™t win in 2020, too much success!
@realDonaldTrump	....President Trump deserves a lot of credit, but again, you have the anti-Trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit.â€
@realDonaldTrump	Michael Pillsbury interviewed by @cvpayne: â€œThey have the motive of making the President look bad â€“ instead of President Trump being portrayed as a HERO. The first President to take China on, itâ€™s 20 years overdue....
@realDonaldTrump	V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House. Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer, or to our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œFormer @NYTimes editor Jill Abramson rips paper's â€˜unmistakably anti-Trumpâ€™ bias.â€
@realDonaldTrump	Great Tweet today by Tyler Q. Houlton @SpoxDHS on the #FakeNews being put out by @CNN, a proud member of the Opposition Party. @TSA is doing a great job!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they donâ€™t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!
@realDonaldTrump	We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL!  In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS-13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.
@realDonaldTrump	I donâ€™t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems?
@realDonaldTrump	Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama & the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine & settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!
@realDonaldTrump	Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Kanye West for your nice words. Criminal Justice Reform is now law - passed in a very bipartisan way!
@realDonaldTrump	Great new book by Dr. Robert Jeffress, â€œChoosing the Extraordinary Life.â€ Get it and enjoy!  @LouDobbs
@realDonaldTrump	V.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger & less obtrusive. Good solution, and made in the U.S.A.
@realDonaldTrump	Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole. We have just killed the leader of that attack, Jamal al-Badawi. Our work against al Qaeda continues. We will never stop in our fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism!
@realDonaldTrump	Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President El-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future!
@realDonaldTrump	....The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end, crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked...â€ Barrack Obama, 2005. I voted, when I was a Senator, to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...â€ Hillary Clinton, 2015.
@realDonaldTrump	Will be going to Camp David tomorrow morning for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with @WhiteHouse senior staff.
@realDonaldTrump	AP-NORC POLL: â€œImmigration among the top concerns in 2019.â€ People want to stop drugs and criminals at the Border. Want Border Security! Tell the Dems to do the inevitable now, rather than later. The wait is costly and dangerous!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe number of employed Americans has now set a 14th record under President Trump. Over the year, average hourly earnings have increased by 84 cents, or 3.2%. Participation Rate hits Trump-Era High.â€ CNS NEWS.  And we will do even better with new trade deals and all else!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œJobs up big, plus 312,000. Record number working. Manufacturing best in 20 years (Previous administration said this could not happen). Hispanic unemployment lowest ever. Dow plus 747 (for day).â€ @DRUDGE_REPORT
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.
@realDonaldTrump	The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria. No different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!.....
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman Adam Smith, the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just stated, â€œYes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. Itâ€™s been done a number of times.â€ No doubt, but letâ€™s get our deal done in Congress!
@realDonaldTrump	....The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party. It is truly the Enemy of the People! We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!
@realDonaldTrump	...The Fake News will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the Trump Administration, and me, look as bad as possible. They use non-existent sources & write stories that are total fiction. Our Country is doing so well, yet this is a sad day in America!
@realDonaldTrump	With all of the success that our Country is having, including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts, the Fake News & totally dishonest Media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse. Many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the TRUTH!...
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to a truly great football team, the Clemson Tigers, on an incredible win last night against a powerful Alabama team. A big win also for the Great State of South Carolina. Look forward to seeing the team, and their brilliant coach, for the second time at the W.H.
@realDonaldTrump	Talks with China are going very well!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe President is the biggest and best supporter of the Steel Industry in many years. We are now doing really well. The Tariffs let us compete. Was unfair that the Steel Industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws. Very positive outcome.â€ Mark Glyptis, United Steelworkers
@realDonaldTrump	Economic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration, rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. That would have been SO EASY! Still, markets up BIG since 2016 Election!
@realDonaldTrump	Endless Wars, especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago, & those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing, will eventually come to a glorious end!
@realDonaldTrump	Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to all of America's brave police, deputies, sheriffs, and federal law enforcement on National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day! We love you and will always support you. pic.twitter.com/kGL6kPmpDY
@realDonaldTrump	Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Country is doing so well in so many ways. Great jobs numbers, with a record setting December. We are rebuilding our military. Vets finally have Choice & Accountability. Economy & GDP are strong. Tax & Reg cuts historic. Trade deals great. But we MUST fix our Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!
@realDonaldTrump	From the Southern Border.... pic.twitter.com/Vgsf5nEZUH
@realDonaldTrump	Because of the Democrats intransigence on Border Security and the great importance of Safety for our Nation, I am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to Davos, Switzerland for the World Economic Forum. My warmest regards and apologies to the @WEF!
@realDonaldTrump	President Obama, thank you for your great support â€“ I have been saying this all along! pic.twitter.com/L506g9Aq4z
@realDonaldTrump	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Texas! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	â€œGreat support for Border Security and the Wall.â€ @foxandfriends  Even greater than anyone would know! â€œPresidents supporters do not want him to cave.â€ @SteveDoocy I wonâ€™t!
@realDonaldTrump	There is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate, despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. The Opposition Party & the Dems know we must have Strong Border Security, but donâ€™t want to give â€œTrumpâ€ another one of many wins!
@realDonaldTrump	Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I â€œslammed the table & walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.â€ Because I knew he would say that, and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security, I politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!
@realDonaldTrump	Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon, somewhat of a White House tradition or custom, to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now. NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy. They report stories, purposely, the exact opposite of the facts. They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems. May even be worse than Fake News CNN, if that is possible!
@realDonaldTrump	.@CNN called a San Diego news station (@KUSINews) for negative reports on the Wall. When the station said that Walls work, CNN no longer had interest. #FakeNews pic.twitter.com/IDyXqmDsPq
@realDonaldTrump	Drug prices declined in 2018, the first time in nearly half a century. During the first 19 months of my Administration, Americans saved $26 Billion on prescription drugs. Our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working!
@realDonaldTrump	I look forward to hosting, right out of the great State of South Carolina, the 2019 NCAA Football Champion Clemson Tigers at the White House on Monday, January 14th. What a game, what a coach, what a team!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media keeps saying we havenâ€™t built any NEW WALL. Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service! pic.twitter.com/UAAGXl5Byr
@realDonaldTrump	...The Steel Barrier, or Wall, should have been built by previous administrations long ago. They never got it done - I will. Without it, our Country cannot be safe. Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!
@realDonaldTrump	Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand, an invasion! I have been there numerous times - The Democrats, Cryinâ€™ Chuck and Nancy donâ€™t know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY....
@realDonaldTrump	H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship. We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	I often said during rallies, with little variation, that â€œMexico will pay for the Wall.â€ We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over!
@realDonaldTrump	When I took the Oath of Office.... pic.twitter.com/GDhIqteKpv
@realDonaldTrump	We lose 300 Americans a week, 90% of which comes through the Southern Border. These numbers will be DRASTICALLY REDUCED if we have a Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be interviewed at the Border by @seanhannity on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Dear Diary... https://twitter.com/Acosta/status/1083440238075236353Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their â€œvacationsâ€ and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!
@realDonaldTrump	....I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!
@realDonaldTrump	I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is â€œchaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.â€ The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, thereâ€™s almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and...
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.
@realDonaldTrump	23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants. Border arrests are up 240%. In the Great State of Texas, between 2011 & 2018, there were a total of 292,000 crimes by illegal aliens, 539 murders, 32,000 assaults, 3,426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown, while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you!
@realDonaldTrump	Lyinâ€™ James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the â€œinsurance policy?â€ This is it!
@realDonaldTrump	I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, & as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!
@realDonaldTrump	.....who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton, her Campaign, and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch!
@realDonaldTrump	....the FBI was in complete turmoil (see N.Y. Post) because of Comeyâ€™s poor leadership and the way he handled the Clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the Justice Department). My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop......
@realDonaldTrump	...Funny thing about James Comey. Everybody wanted him fired, Republican and Democrat alike. After the rigged & botched Crooked Hillary investigation, where she was interviewed on July 4th Weekend, not recorded or sworn in, and where she said she didnâ€™t know anything (a lie),....
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyinâ€™ James Comey, a total sleaze!
@realDonaldTrump	....Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS!
@realDonaldTrump	Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone....
@realDonaldTrump	Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden. Really is something - SPECIAL COUNTRY, SPECIAL PLACE!
@realDonaldTrump	Thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in Texas prisons. Most came through our Southern Border. We can end this easily - We need a Steel Barrier or Wall. Walls Work! John Jones, Texas Department of Public Safety.  @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!
@realDonaldTrump	Iâ€™m in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!
@realDonaldTrump	The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and donâ€™t want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side, watch!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed by Jeanine Pirro at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Watch @JesseBWatters before and @greggutfeld after. All terrific people. I am in the White House waiting for Cryinâ€™ Chuck and Nancy to call so we can start helping our Country both at the Border and from within!
@realDonaldTrump	....I am doing exactly what I pledged to do, and what I was elected to do by the citizens of our great Country. Just as I promised, I am fighting for YOU!
@realDonaldTrump	For decades, politicians promised to secure the border, fix our trade deals, bring back our factories, get tough on China, move the Embassy to Jerusalem, make NATO pay their fair share, and so much else - only to do NOTHING (or worse)....
@realDonaldTrump	Spoke w/ President Erdogan of Turkey to advise where we stand on all matters including our last two weeks of success in fighting the remnants of ISIS, and 20 mile safe zone. Also spoke about economic development between the U.S. & Turkey - great potential to substantially expand!
@realDonaldTrump	Getting ready to go on stage at the #AFBF100 in New Orleans - packed house! I will try and match the great game played yesterday by the New Orleans Saints and their incredible QB, Drew Brees. People here are very excited by the team. Going on stage now! https://twitter.com/FarmBureau/status/1084835531572301829Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News gets crazier and more dishonest every single day. Amazing to watch as certain people covering me, and the tremendous success of this administration, have truly gone MAD! Their Fake reporting creates anger and disunity. Take two weeks off and come back rested. Chill!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œDems in Puerto Rico as Shutdown hits day 24.â€ @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy and Cryinâ€™ Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!
@realDonaldTrump	Iâ€™ve been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œGas prices drop across the United States because President Trump has deregulated Energy and we are now  producing a great deal more oil than ever before.â€ @foxandfriends  But this is bad news for Russia, why would President Trump do such a thing? Thought he worked for Kremlin?
@realDonaldTrump	....Border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the United States, as we have known it, is going to cease to exist...And Americans will not go gentle into that good night. Patrick Buchanan.  The great people of our Country demand proper Border Security NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	The Trump portrait of an unsustainable Border Crisis is dead on. â€œIn the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with Criminal Records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes & 4000 violent killings.â€ Americaâ€™s Southern....
@realDonaldTrump	Best line in the Elizabeth Warren beer catastrophe is, to her husband, â€œThank you for being here. Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re hereâ€ Itâ€™s their house, heâ€™s supposed to be there!
@realDonaldTrump	If Elizabeth Warren, often referred to by me as Pocahontas, did this commercial from Bighorn or Wounded Knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full Indian garb, it would have been a smash! pic.twitter.com/D5KWr8EPan
@realDonaldTrump	So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!
@realDonaldTrump	Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamburgers etc. Within one hour, it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters!
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations @ClemsonFB! pic.twitter.com/w8viax0OWY
@realDonaldTrump	Why is Nancy Pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not?
@realDonaldTrump	Polls are now showing that people are beginning to understand the Humanitarian Crisis and Crime at the Border. Numbers are going up fast, over 50%. Democrats will soon be known as the Party of Crime. Ridiculous that they donâ€™t want Border Security!
@realDonaldTrump	A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!
@realDonaldTrump	Volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They will be making Electric Cars. Congratulations to Chattanooga and Tennessee on a job well done. A big win!
@realDonaldTrump	Just announced that Veterans unemployment has reached an 18 year low, really good news for our Vets and their families. Will soon be an all time low! Do you think the media will report on this and all of the other great economic news?
@realDonaldTrump	The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyinâ€™ James Comey and the so-called â€œleadersâ€ of the FBI. Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!
@realDonaldTrump	It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime. They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border. #2020!
@realDonaldTrump	There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	So funny to watch Schumer groveling. He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times - UNTIL I FIRED HIM!
@realDonaldTrump	The Left has become totally unhinged. They no longer care what is Right for our Countrty!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border, and the Shutdown, tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M., live from the @WhiteHouse.
@realDonaldTrump	AMERICA FIRST!
@realDonaldTrump	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Never seen the Republican Party so unified. No â€œCaveâ€ on the issue of Border and National Security. A beautiful thing to see, especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the Democrats who talk Open Border, High Taxes and Crime. Stop Criminals & Drugs now!
@realDonaldTrump	Kevin Corke, @FoxNews â€œDonâ€™t forget, Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....â€  Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law!
@realDonaldTrump	Another big Caravan heading our way. Very hard to stop without a Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œItâ€™s the Democrats keeping everything closed.â€ @JimInhofe  So true!
@realDonaldTrump	Why would Nancy Pelosi leave the Country with other Democrats on a seven day excursion when 800,000 great people are not getting paid. Also, could somebody please explain to Nancy & her â€œbig donorsâ€ in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in!
@realDonaldTrump	Border rancher: â€œWeâ€™ve found prayer rugs out here. Itâ€™s unreal.â€  Washington Examiner   People coming across the Southern Border from many countries, some of which would be a big surprise.
@realDonaldTrump	Gregg Jarrett: â€œMuellerâ€™s prosecutors knew the â€œDossierâ€ was the product of bias and deception.â€ It was a Fake, just like so much news coverage in our Country. Nothing but a Witch Hunt, from beginning to end!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œIn 2018 alone, 20,000 illegal aliens with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the Border, and there was a 122% increase in fentanyl being smuggled between ports of entry. Last month alone, more than 20,000 minors were smuggled into the U.S.â€ @seanhannity
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Amy Kremer, Women for Trump Co-Founder, for doing such a great interview with Martha MacCallum...and by the way, women have the lowest unemployment numbers in many decades - at the highest pay ever. Proud of that!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be live from the White House at 4:00 P.M.
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico is doing NOTHING to stop the Caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the United States. We stopped the last two - many are still in Mexico but canâ€™t get through our Wall, but it takes a lot of Border Agents if there is no Wall. Not easy!
@realDonaldTrump	Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up), as highlighted by the disgraceful Buzzfeed story & the even more disgraceful coverage!
@realDonaldTrump	The Economy is one of the best in our history, with unemployment at a 50 year low, and the Stock Market ready to again break a record (set by us many times) - & all you heard yesterday, based on a phony story, was Impeachment. You want to see a Stock Market Crash, Impeach Trump!
@realDonaldTrump	.@newtgingrich just stated that there has been no president since Abraham Lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite President, me! At the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be leaving for Dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News is truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
@realDonaldTrump	Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited â€œDossier,â€ paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research), on which the entire Russian probe is based! A very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Just a son who loves his Dad. Nice! https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/971870502204727298Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea. Think of where we were at the end of the Obama Administration compared to now. Great meeting this week with top Reps. Looking forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at end of February!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you David! https://twitter.com/DavidWohl/status/1086461107244490752Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Donâ€™t forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy, I am still thinking about the State of the Union speech, there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the Shutdown, security is no problem), and my written acceptance. While a contract is a contract, Iâ€™ll get back to you soon!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the â€œleftiesâ€ in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!
@realDonaldTrump	No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful Nancy!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They donâ€™t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.
@realDonaldTrump	Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from  tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldnâ€™t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!
@realDonaldTrump	Always heard that as President, â€œitâ€™s all about the economy!â€ Well, we have one of the best economies in the history of our Country. Big GDP, lowest unemployment, companies coming back to the U.S. in BIG numbers, great new trade deals happening, & more. But LITTLE media mention!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are kidding themselves (they donâ€™t really believe it!) if they say you can stop Crime, Drugs, Human Trafficking and Caravans without a Wall or Steel Barrier. Stop playing games and give America the Security it deserves. A Humanitarian Crisis!
@realDonaldTrump	Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are â€œimmoral,â€ why isnâ€™t she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico, even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging. Let millions of unchecked â€œstrangersâ€ just flow into the U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	China posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies. Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!

@realDonaldTrump	Last year was the best year for American Manufacturing job growth since 1997, or 21 years. The previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the U.S., â€œyou would need a magic wand.â€ I guess I found the MAGIC WAND - and it is only getting better!

@realDonaldTrump	To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say, THANK YOU - YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS! We must now work together, after decades of abuse, to finally fix the Humanitarian, Criminal & Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!

@realDonaldTrump	Former FBI top lawyer James Baker just admitted involvement in FISA Warrant and further admitted there  were IRREGULARITIES in the way the Russia probe was handled. They relied heavily on the unverified Trump â€œDossierâ€ paid for by the DNC & Clinton Campaign, & funded through a...
@realDonaldTrump	The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the â€œpodiumâ€ much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly & hence, the term, Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States has a great economic story to tell. Number one in the World, by far!
@realDonaldTrump	Last time I went to Davos, the Fake News said I should not go there. This year, because of the Shutdown, I decided not to go, and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!
@realDonaldTrump	Never seen @senatemajldr and Republicans so united on an issue as they are on the Humanitarian Crisis & Security on our Southern Border. If we create a Wall or Barrier which prevents Criminals and Drugs from flowing into our Country, Crime will go down by record numbers!
@realDonaldTrump	Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trumpâ€™s approval rating among Latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you, working hard!
@realDonaldTrump	FBI top lawyer confirms â€œunusual steps.â€ They relied on the Clinton Campaignâ€™s Fake & Unverified â€œDossier,â€ which is illegal. â€œThat has corrupted them. That has enabled them to gather evidence by UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS, and thatâ€™s what they did to the President.â€ Judge Napolitano
@realDonaldTrump	Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security. With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier, Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S. The Dems know this but want to play political games. Must finally be done correctly. No Cave!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe Democrats are playing politics with Border Security.â€  @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	Nick Sandmann and the students of Covington have become symbols of Fake News and how evil it can be. They have captivated the attention of the world, and I know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. It started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking like Nick Sandman & Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media.

@realDonaldTrump	Nancy just said she â€œjust doesnâ€™t understand why?â€ Very simply, without a Wall it all doesnâ€™t work. Our Country has a chance to greatly reduce Crime, Human Trafficking, Gangs and Drugs. Should have been done for decades. We will not Cave!
@realDonaldTrump	Without a Wall there cannot be safety and security at the Border or for the U.S.A. BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL!

@realDonaldTrump	So interesting that bad lawyer Michael Cohen, who sadly will not be testifying before Congress, is using the lawyer of Crooked Hillary Clinton to represent him - Gee, how did that happen? Remember July 4th weekend when Crooked went before FBI & wasnâ€™t sworn in, no tape, nothing?

@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to the Republican National Committee, (the RNC), who voted UNANIMOUSLY yesterday to support me in the upcoming 2020 Election. Considering that we have done more than any Administration in the first two years, this should be easy. More great things now in the works!
@realDonaldTrump	We have turned away, at great expense, two major Caravans, but a big one has now formed and is coming. At least 8000 people! If we had a powerful Wall, they wouldnâ€™t even try to make the long and dangerous journey. Build the Wall and Crime will Fall!
@realDonaldTrump	21 days goes very quickly. Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border & through dialogue. We will build the Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œI like the fact that the President is making the case (Border Security & Crime) to the American people. Now we know where Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer & the Democrats stand, which is no Border Security. Will be big 2020 issue.â€ Matt Schlapp, Chair, ACU. Bigger than anyone knows!

@realDonaldTrump	I wish people would read or listen to my words on the Border Wall. This was in no way a concession. It was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the Shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, itâ€™s off to the races!

@realDonaldTrump	We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. Cost Friday was $603,331,392. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our Country. So ridiculous! DHS
@realDonaldTrump	58,000 non-citizens voted in Texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. All over the country, especially in California, voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped. Strong voter ID! @foxandfriends

@realDonaldTrump	Howard Schultz doesnâ€™t have the â€œgutsâ€ to run for President! Watched him on @60Minutes last night and I agree with him that he is not the â€œsmartest person.â€ Besides, America already has that! I only hope that Starbucks is still paying me their rent in Trump Tower!
@realDonaldTrump	Numerous states introducing Bible Literacy classes, giving students the option of studying the Bible. Starting to make a turn back? Great!

@realDonaldTrump	After all that I have done for the Military, our great Veterans, Judges (99), Justices (2), Tax & Regulation Cuts, the Economy, Energy, Trade & MUCH MORE, does anybody really think I wonâ€™t build the WALL? Done more in first two years than any President! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Never thought Iâ€™d say this but I think @johnrobertsFox and @GillianHTurner @FoxNews have even less understanding of the Wall negotiations than the folks at FAKE NEWS CNN & NBC! Look to final results! Donâ€™t know how my poll numbers are so good, especially up 19% with Hispanics?
@realDonaldTrump	A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction. He pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer. He signed a non-disclosure agreement. He is a mess!

@realDonaldTrump	Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran. They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country. Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination. Dems put us in a bad place - but now good!

@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are becoming the Party of late term abortion, high taxes, Open Borders and Crime!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time.

@realDonaldTrump	Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!
@realDonaldTrump	Large sections of WALL have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. Renovation of existing WALLS is also a very big part of the plan to finally, after many decades, properly Secure Our Border. The Wall is getting done one way or the other!

@realDonaldTrump	I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan, the â€œEndless Warsâ€ of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said, very strongly, that these wars must finally end.

@realDonaldTrump	Everyone is asking how Tiger played yesterday. The answer is Great! He was long, straight & putted fantastically well. He shot a 64. Tiger is back & will be winning Majors again! Not surprisingly, Jack also played really well. His putting is amazing! Jack & Tiger like each other.
@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed Sunday morning on @FaceTheNation and prior to the Super Bowl on @CBS at 3:30 P.M. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Ed Gillespie, who ran for Governor of the Great State of Virginia against Ralph Northam, must now be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty with regard to his Opposition Research Staff. If they find that terrible picture before the election, he wins by 20 points!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated, â€œI believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.â€ This was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on â€œsuperâ€ late term abortion. Unforgivable!
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce that David Bernhardt, Acting Secretary of the Interior, will be nominated as Secretary of the Interior. David has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived, and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to tonight! #SOTU pic.twitter.com/lGKkZeaxUZ
@realDonaldTrump	Melania and I send our greetings to those celebrating the Lunar New Year. Today, people across the United States and around the world mark the beginning of the Lunar New Year with spectacular fireworks displays, joyful festivals, and family gatherings... https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/presidential-message-celebration-lunar-new-year-2/Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech, even though he hasnâ€™t seen it yet. Heâ€™s just upset that he didnâ€™t win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would. Too bad we werenâ€™t given more credit for the Senate win by the media!
@realDonaldTrump	Tremendous numbers of people are coming up through Mexico in the hopes of flooding our Southern Border. We have sent additional military. We will build a Human Wall if necessary. If we had a real Wall, this would be a non-event!
@realDonaldTrump	Today, it was my great honor to sign a Presidential Memorandum launching the Womenâ€™s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative. #WGDP 
@realDonaldTrump	2019 National Prayer Breakfast https://www.pscp.tv/w/byxD4TFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MURYeHlhWGplWVp4TeIF_xGVyLqm6aH3bmlZ6TkP0k0qriuyexeNqCxFHKAS?t=1sÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats at the top are killing the Great State of Virginia. If the three failing pols were Republicans, far stronger action would be taken. Virginia will come back HOME Republican) in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	....The Dems and their committees are going â€œnuts.â€ The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment....
@realDonaldTrump	I was a big fan of Frank Robinson, both as a great player and man. He was the first African American manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did. He will he missed!
@realDonaldTrump	Deepest sympathies to Congresswoman Debbie Dingell and the entire family of John Dingell. Longest serving Congressman in Countryâ€™s history which, if people understand politics, means he was very smart. A great reputation and highly respected man.
@realDonaldTrump	Working hard, thank you! pic.twitter.com/tnuHnw8kll
@realDonaldTrump	...It is all a GIANT AND ILLEGAL HOAX, developed long before the election itself, but used as an excuse by the Democrats as to why Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the Election! Someday the Fake News Media will turn honest & report that Donald J. Trump was actually a GREAT Candidate!
@realDonaldTrump	The mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the VERY important Senate Intelligence Committee, after two years of intensive study and access to Intelligence that only they could get, just stated that they have found NO COLLUSION between â€œTrumpâ€ & Russia....
@realDonaldTrump	Now we find out that Adam Schiff was spending time together in Aspen with Glenn Simpson of GPS Fusion, who wrote the fake and discredited Dossier, even though Simpson was testifying before Schiff. John Solomon of @thehill
@realDonaldTrump	Not only did Senator Burrâ€™s Committee find No Collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia, itâ€™s important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300,000 pages of documents, & the Committee has direct access to intelligence information thatâ€™s Classified. @GreggJarrett
@realDonaldTrump	Highly respected Senator Richard Burr, Chairman of Senate Intelligence, said today that, after an almost two year investigation, he saw no evidence of Russia collusion. â€œWe donâ€™t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.â€  Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	So nice how well my State of the Union speech was received. Thank you to all!
@realDonaldTrump	Each year, America pauses to remember its fallen astronaut heroes and the great accomplishments for which they strived. @FLOTUS Melania and I mourn their passing and take to heart the lessons of their lives and the greater human potential to which they continue to inspire. https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1093650615912316928Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called â€œCarbon Footprintâ€ to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!
@realDonaldTrump	Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats just donâ€™t seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports, they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other!
@realDonaldTrump	We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks. If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election, the U.S. would be in a Depression right now! We were heading down, and donâ€™t let the Democrats sound bites fool you!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!
@realDonaldTrump	It was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both Syria and Afghanistan. Their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high. They will recoverer & be back very soon. America loves them. Walter Reed Hospital is AMAZING - Thank you all!
@realDonaldTrump	North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse. He may surprise some but he wonâ€™t surprise me, because I have gotten to know him & fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic one!
@realDonaldTrump	My representatives have just left North Korea after a very productive meeting and an agreed upon time and date for the second Summit with Kim Jong Un. It will take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, on February 27 & 28. I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim & advancing the cause of peace!
@realDonaldTrump	The U.S. will soon control 100% of ISIS territory in Syria. @CNN (do you believe this?).
@realDonaldTrump	Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!
@realDonaldTrump	The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they donâ€™t even want to take muderers into custody! Whatâ€™s going on?
@realDonaldTrump	â€œPresident is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency. There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.â€ Congressman @tommcclintock
@realDonaldTrump	....The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess. Depleted Military, Endless Wars, a potential War with North Korea, V.A., High Taxes & too many Regulations, Border, Immigration & HealthCare problems, & much more. I had no choice but to work very long hours!
@realDonaldTrump	The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President.....
@realDonaldTrump	It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!
@realDonaldTrump	I donâ€™t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!
@realDonaldTrump	Gallup Poll: â€œOpen Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans.â€ This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!
@realDonaldTrump	African Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia!
@realDonaldTrump	Senator Richard Burr, The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that after almost two years, more than two hundred interviews, and thousands of documents, they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this?
@realDonaldTrump	Coal is an important part of our electricity generation mix and @TVAnews should give serious consideration to all factors before voting to close viable power plants, like Paradise #3 in Kentucky!
@realDonaldTrump	40 years of corruption. 40 years of repression. 40 years of terror. The regime in Iran has produced only #40YearsofFailure. The long-suffering Iranian people deserve a much brighter future. pic.twitter.com/bA8YGsw9LA
@realDonaldTrump	Will be heading to El Paso very soon. Big speech on Border Security and much else tonight. Tremendous crowd! See you later!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are so self righteous and ANGRY! Loosen up and have some fun. The Country is doing well!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	No president ever worked harder than me (cleaning up the mess I inherited)!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œFact checkers have become Fake News.â€ @JesseBWatters   So True!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to @MSNBC! pic.twitter.com/VdRnirACAz
@realDonaldTrump	....Will be getting almost $23 BILLION for Border Security. Regardless of Wall money, it is being built as we speak!
@realDonaldTrump	Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator Richard Shelby. Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources....
@realDonaldTrump	Beautiful evening in El Paso, Texas last night. God Bless the USA! pic.twitter.com/trqA75KxLN
@realDonaldTrump	We are fighting for all Americans, from all backgrounds, of every age, race, religion, birthplace, color & creed.

@realDonaldTrump	The Gallup Poll just announced that 69% of our great citizens expect their finances to improve next year, a 16 year high. Nice!
@realDonaldTrump	The Senate Intelligence Committee: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA!
@realDonaldTrump	I want to thank all Republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the Radical Left on Border Security. Not an easy task, but the Wall is being built and will be a great achievement and contributor toward life and safety within our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	One year ago today, a horrific act of violence took the lives of 14 students and 3 educators in Parkland, Florida. On this somber anniversary, we honor their memory and recommit to ensuring the safety of all Americans, especially our Nationâ€™s children...  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/presidential-message-school-safety-remembering-parkland-tragedy/Â â€¦ pic.twitter.com/EVAeSwA8oV

@realDonaldTrump	....Many of the top FBI brass were fired, forced to leave, or left. McCabeâ€™s wife received BIG DOLLARS from Clinton people for her campaign - he gave Hillary a pass. McCabe is a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a â€œpoor little Angelâ€ when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal & the Russia Hoax - a puppet for Leakinâ€™ James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating. Part of â€œinsurance policyâ€ in case I won....
@realDonaldTrump	California has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars. They owe the Federal Government three and a half billion dollars. We want that money back now. Whole project is a â€œgreenâ€ disaster!
@realDonaldTrump	Great job by law enforcement in Aurora, Illinois. Heartfelt condolences to all of the victims and their families. America is with you!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œTrying to use the 25th Amendment to try and circumvent the Election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing...which happens in third world countries. You have to obey the law. This is an attack on our system & Constitution.â€ Alan Dershowitz. @TuckerCarlson
@realDonaldTrump	â€œAfter The Flight 93 Election, The Vote That Saved America - And What We Still Have To Lose,â€ by very talented Michael Anton, is a terrific read. Check it out!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mueller investigation is totally conflicted, illegal and rigged! Should never have been allowed to begin, except for the Collusion and many crimes committed by the Democrats. Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThese guys, the investigators, ought to be in jail. What they have done, working with the Obama intelligence agencies, is simply unprecedented. This is one of the greatest political hoaxes ever perpetrated on the people of this Country, and Mueller is a coverup.â€  Rush Limbaugh
@realDonaldTrump	THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
@realDonaldTrump	Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is, how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!
@realDonaldTrump	52% Approval Rating, 93% in Republican Party ( a record )! Pretty amazing considering that 93% (also) of my press is REALLY BAD. The â€œpeopleâ€ are SMART!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats in the Senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government. Never been such an abuse in our countryâ€™s history. Mitch should not let Senate go home until all are approved. We need our Ambassadors and all others NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	Important meetings and calls on China Trade Deal, and more, today with my staff. Big progress being made on soooo many different fronts! Our Country has such fantastic potential for future growth and greatness on an even higher level!
@realDonaldTrump	....The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them........
@realDonaldTrump	Trade negotiators have just returned from China where the meetings on Trade were very productive. Now at meetings with me at Mar-a-Lago giving the details. In the meantime, Billions of Dollars are being paid to the United States by China in the form of Trade Tariffs!

@realDonaldTrump	I ask every member of the Maduro regime: End this nightmare of poverty, hunger and death. LET YOUR PEOPLE GO. Set your country free! Now is the time for all Venezuelan Patriots to act together, as one united people. Nothing could be better for the future of Venezuela!

@realDonaldTrump	....There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the Military, Vets, Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous â€œinsurance policyâ€ in full action!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught.....

@realDonaldTrump	I never said anything bad about Andrew McCabeâ€™s wife other than she (they) should not have taken large amounts of campaign money from a Crooked Hillary source when Clinton was under investigation by the FBI. I never called his wife a loser to him (another McCabe made up lie)!
@realDonaldTrump	The Washington Post is a Fact Checker only for the Democrats. For the Republicans, and for your all time favorite President, it is a Fake Fact Checker!
@realDonaldTrump	The failed Fast Train project in California, where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting, is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	As I predicted, 16 states, led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left, have filed a lawsuit in, of course, the 9th Circuit! California, the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train, with no hope of completion, seems in charge!
@realDonaldTrump	Had the opposition party (no, not the Media) won the election, the Stock Market would be down at least 10,000 points by now. We are heading up, up, up!

@realDonaldTrump	California now wants to scale back their already failed â€œfast trainâ€ project by substantially shortening the distance so that it no longer goes from L.A. to San Francisco. A different deal and record cost overruns. Send the Federal Government back the Billions of Dollars WASTED!
@realDonaldTrump	The New York Times reporting is false. They are a true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œIf thinking that James Comey is not a good FBI Director is tantamount to being an agent of Russia, than just list all the people that are agents of Russia - Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Rod Rosenstein who wrote the memo to get rid of Comey, the Inspector General....â€ Trey Gowdy

@realDonaldTrump	Chairman Kim realizes, perhaps better than anyone else, that without nuclear weapons, his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him), it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!
@realDonaldTrump	President Xi of China has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with Kim Jong Un. The last thing China wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door. Sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful. Great relationship with Chairman Kim!
@realDonaldTrump	Very productive talks yesterday with China on Trade. Will continue today! I will be leaving for Hanoi, Vietnam, early tomorrow for a Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea, where we both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore. Denuclearization?

Without strong Borders, we donâ€™t have a Country - and the voters are on board with us. Be strong and smart, donâ€™t fall into the Democrats â€œtrapâ€ of Open Borders and Crime!
@realDonaldTrump	Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception, only to be replaced by another beauty, Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!
@realDonaldTrump	Meeting for breakfast with our Nationâ€™s Governors - then off to Vietnam for a very important Summit with Kim Jong Un. With complete Denuclearization, North Korea will rapidly become an Economic Powerhouse. Without it, just more of the same. Chairman Kim will make a wise decision!
@realDonaldTrump	Oil prices getting too high. OPEC, please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike - fragile!
@realDonaldTrump	Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes, or better yet not have to use notes at all, when doing his racist hit on your President, who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform, Lowest Unemployment numbers in History, Tax Cuts,etc.) than almost any other Pres!
@realDonaldTrump	We have a State of Emergency at our Southern Border. Border Patrol, our Military and local Law Enforcement are doing a great job, but without the Wall, which is now under major construction, you cannot have Border Security. Drugs, Gangs and Human Trafficking must be stopped!
@realDonaldTrump	Just arrived in Vietnam. Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi. Tremendous crowds, and so much love!
@realDonaldTrump	....This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on, itâ€™s protecting the lives of innocent babies.
@realDonaldTrump	Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position on abortion is now so extreme that they donâ€™t mind executing babies AFTER birth....
@realDonaldTrump	If a deal is made with China, our great American Farmers will be treated better than they have ever been treated before!
@realDonaldTrump	Great meeting and dinner with Kim Jong Un in Hanoi, Vietnam tonight. Looking forward to continuing our discussions tomorrow! #HanoiSummit pic.twitter.com/J3x6lUGzjS
@realDonaldTrump	Great meetings and dinner tonight in Vietnam with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Very good dialogue. Resuming tomorrow!
@realDonaldTrump	All false reporting (guessing) on my intentions with respect to North Korea. Kim Jong Un and I will try very hard to work something out on Denuclearization & then making North Korea an Economic Powerhouse. I believe that China, Russia, Japan & South Korea will be very helpful!
@realDonaldTrump	Fiat Chrysler will be adding more than 6,500 JOBS in Michigan (Detroit area), doubling its hourly workforce as part of a 4.5 Billion Dollar investment. Thank you Fiat Chrysler. They are all coming back to the USA, itâ€™s where the action is!
@realDonaldTrump	Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crookedâ€™s lawyer!
@realDonaldTrump	I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didnâ€™t do â€œitâ€ during eight years of the Obama Administration?
@realDonaldTrump	Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!
@realDonaldTrump	THANK YOU to our generous hosts in Hanoi this week: President Trong, Prime Minister Phuc, and the wonderful people of Vietnam! pic.twitter.com/AMqF0dfRhP
@realDonaldTrump	....and I did not increase their second traunch of Tariffs to 25% on March 1st. This is very important for our great farmers - and me!
@realDonaldTrump	I have asked China to immediately remove all Tariffs on our agricultural products (including beef, pork, etc.) based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with Trade discussions....
@realDonaldTrump	....for Ottoâ€™s mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain. Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often!
@realDonaldTrump	I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous Administration did nothing, and he was taken on their watch. Of course I hold North Korea responsible....
@realDonaldTrump	Michael Cohenâ€™s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clintonâ€™s lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?
@realDonaldTrump	...and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, itâ€™s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!
@realDonaldTrump	Ohâ€™ I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, â€œgee, I have an idea, letâ€™s look at Trumpâ€™s finances and every deal he has ever done. Letâ€™s follow discredited Michael Cohen.....
@realDonaldTrump	Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohenâ€™s new book, given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions  against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a â€œlove letter to Trumpâ€ manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki, his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!
@realDonaldTrump	Great to be back from Vietnam, an amazing place. We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong Un - we know what they want and they know what we must have. Relationship very good, letâ€™s see what happens!
@realDonaldTrump	Today in Alaska, it was my great honor to visit with our brave men and women of the United States Military at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. We are forever grateful for their service and sacrifice. THANK YOU! pic.twitter.com/4REVxKUsHT
@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed by @seanhannity at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Enjoy!

@realDonaldTrump	@TeamCavuto  It was a 3 day train ride to Vietnam, not 3 hours!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be speaking at CPAC at 11:30 this morning. Record crowd, live broadcast. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Very proud of perhaps the greatest golf course anywhere in the world. Also, furthers U.K. relationship! https://twitter.com/Trump/status/1100526297653174274Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also, reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing!
@realDonaldTrump	My wonderful daughter, Ivanka, will be interviewed tonight by Steve Hilton on â€œThe Next Revolution.â€ @FoxNews 9:00 P.M. She works so hard and has achieved so much for the U.S.A.(and gets so little credit!). Then watch Mark Levin at 10:00 P.M., a great show!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œLook how theyâ€™re acting now and how we act when weâ€™re in the majority. What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power. They couldnâ€™t find anything...they took a Fake Dossier & couldnâ€™t find any Collusion. Now they have a fake witness in Cohen.â€ Congressman Mark Green, (R-TN).
@realDonaldTrump	After more than two years of Presidential Harassment, the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law. The hostile Cohen testimony, given by a liar to reduce his prison time, proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he.....
@realDonaldTrump	...said was a total lie, but Fake Media wonâ€™t show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted & corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal & should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election! Despite this, great success!
@realDonaldTrump	Weâ€™ve got NASA â€œrockingâ€ again. Great activity and success. Congrats to SPACEX and all!
@realDonaldTrump	The brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer Michael Cohen shows his testimony was a total lie! Pundits should only use it.
@realDonaldTrump	Virtually everything failed lawyer Michael Cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me. Itâ€™s a total new love letter to â€œTrumpâ€ and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThere is no Collusion. All of these investigations are in search of a crime. Democrats have no evidence to impeach President Trump. Ridiculous!â€ @DevinNunes @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	â€œNow that the Dems are going to try & switch from Collusion to some other reason, it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didnâ€™t accept the WILL OF THE PEOPLE in the last election - they will do anything to get rid of the President.â€ @AriFleischer It will never work!
@realDonaldTrump	The military drills, or war games as I call them, were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NKâ€”FAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those â€œgamesâ€, especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!
@realDonaldTrump	FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey, one of the best in our Country, has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).
@realDonaldTrump	To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!
@realDonaldTrump	And also illegally leaking to Fake News CNN & others? https://twitter.com/KimStrassel/status/1101229832065691650Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Schumer & the Democrats are hurting our Country. Senate Republicans must take BOLD ACTION! https://twitter.com/KimStrassel/status/1101576439416193025Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	For the Democrats to interview in open hearings a convicted liar & fraudster, at the same time as the very important Nuclear Summit with North Korea, is perhaps a new low in American politics and may have contributed to the â€œwalk.â€ Never done when a president is overseas. Shame!
@realDonaldTrump	....President. We are WINNING big, the envy of the WORLD, but just think what it could be?
@realDonaldTrump	Presidential Harassment by â€œcrazedâ€ Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country. Likewise, the most vicious and corrupt Mainstream Media that any president has ever had to endure - Yet the most successful first two years for any
@realDonaldTrump	â€œ(Crooked) Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020, rules out a third bid for White House.â€ Aw-shucks, does that mean I wonâ€™t get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed!
@realDonaldTrump	....Scott has helped us to lower drug prices, get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market, and so many other things. He and his talents will be greatly missed!
@realDonaldTrump	Scott Gottlieb, who has done an absolutely terrific job as Commissioner of the FDA, plans to leave government service sometime next month....
@realDonaldTrump	Just a few moments ago, I signed an EO addressing one of our nationâ€™s most heartbreaking tragedies: VETERANS SUICIDE.

@realDonaldTrump	Republican Approval Rating just hit 93%. Sorry Haters! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	The greatest overreach in the history of our Country. The Dems are obstructing justice and will not get anything done. A big, fat, fishing expedition desperately in search of a crime, when in fact the real crime is what the Dems are doing, and have done!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œHIV Is Cured In 2nd Patient, Doctors Report.â€ @nytimes  Such great news for so many. Tremendous progress being made!
@realDonaldTrump	Now that they realize the only Collusion with Russia was done by Crooked Hillary Clinton & the Democrats, Nadler, Schiff and the Dem heads of the Committees have gone stone cold CRAZY. 81 letter sent to innocent people to harass them. They wonâ€™t get ANYTHING done for our Country!

@realDonaldTrump	It is shameful that House Democrats wonâ€™t take a stronger stand against Anti-Semitism in their conference. Anti-Semitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and itâ€™s inconceivable they will not act to condemn it!
@realDonaldTrump	Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent, they are voting on desperately needed Border Security & the Wall. Our Country is being invaded with Drugs, Human Traffickers, & Criminals of all shapes and sizes. Thatâ€™s what this vote is all about. STAY UNITED!

@realDonaldTrump	Hans Von Spakovsky, â€œI havenâ€™t seen any evidence of actual violations of the law, which is usually a basis before you start an investigation.

@realDonaldTrump	Breaking News @MSNBC: â€œCohenâ€™s lawyer contradicts Cohenâ€™s testimony about never seeking a Presidential Pardon.â€
@realDonaldTrump	We are on track to APPREHEND more than one million people coming across the Southern Border this year. Great job by Border Patrol (and others) who are working in a Broken System. Can be fixed by Congress so easily and quickly if only the Democrats would get on board!
@realDonaldTrump	It was not a campaign contribution, and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me. Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate. Good, then I think Iâ€™ll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates!

@realDonaldTrump	Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally, he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!

@realDonaldTrump	Wacky Nut Job @AnnCoulter, who still hasnâ€™t figured out that, despite all odds and an entire Democrat Party of Far Left Radicals against me (not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight), I am winning on the Border. Major sections of Wall are being built...
@realDonaldTrump	I hope the grandstanding Governor of California is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the so-called Fast Train, which is $Billions over budget & in total disarray. Time to reduce taxes in California!

@realDonaldTrump	A big National Emergency vote today by The United States Senate on Border Security & the Wall (which is already under major construction). I am prepared to veto, if necessary. The Southern Border is a National Security and Humanitarian Nightmare, but it can be easily fixed!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œDemocrats are frantic to throw something else at the President. Thatâ€™s why you saw those 81 subpoenas. Itâ€™s ridiculous.

@realDonaldTrump	.....THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	....should never have been appointed and there should be no Mueller Report. This was an illegal & conflicted investigation in search of a crime. Russian Collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the Democrats for losing an Election that they thought they were going to win.....
@realDonaldTrump	So, if there was knowingly & acknowledged to be â€œzeroâ€ crime when the Special Counsel was appointed, and if the appointment was made based on the Fake Dossier (paid for by Crooked Hillary) and now disgraced Andrew McCabe (he & all stated no crime), then the Special Counsel.......
@realDonaldTrump	â€œNew evidence that the Obama era team of the FBI, DOJ & CIA were working together to Spy on (and take out) President Trump, all the way back in 2015.â€ A transcript of Peter Strzokâ€™s testimony is devastating.

@realDonaldTrump	The â€˜Jexodusâ€™ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! @OANN @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died, with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!
@realDonaldTrump	How is the Paris Environmental Accord working out for France? After 18 weeks of rioting by the Yellow Vest Protesters, I guess not so well! In the meantime, the United States has gone to the top of all lists on the Environment.
@realDonaldTrump	Google is helping China and their military, but not the U.S. Terrible! The good news is that they helped Crooked Hillary Clinton, and not Trump....and how did that turn out?
@realDonaldTrump	Because the economy is so good, General Motors must get their Lordstown, Ohio, plant open, maybe in a different form or with a new owner, FAST! Toyota is investing 13.5 $Billion in U.S., others likewise. G.M. MUST ACT QUICKLY. Time is of the essence!
@realDonaldTrump	Spreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier â€œis unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain.â€ Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel. He had far worse â€œstainsâ€ than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace!

@realDonaldTrump	On the recent non-binding vote (420-0) in Congress about releasing the Mueller Report, I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesnâ€™t matter. Play along with the game!
@realDonaldTrump	What the Democrats have done in trying to steal a Presidential Election, first at the â€œballot boxâ€ and then, after that failed, with the â€œInsurance Policy,â€ is the biggest Scandal in the history of our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant. I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING. I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union â€” I donâ€™t care, I just want it open!
@realDonaldTrump	Those Republican Senators who voted in favor of Strong Border Security (and the Wall) are being uniformly praised as they return to their States. They know there is a National Emergency at the Southern Border, and they had the courage to ACT. Great job!
@realDonaldTrump	Were @FoxNews weekend anchors, @ArthelNeville and @LelandVittert, trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse? In any event, thatâ€™s where they should be working, along with their lowest rated anchor, Shepard Smith!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce. G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done! 3.8% Unemployment!
@realDonaldTrump	....to the people that got you there. Keep fighting for Tucker, and fight hard for @JudgeJeanine. Your competitors are jealous - they all want what youâ€™ve got - NUMBER ONE. Donâ€™t hand it to them on a silver platter. They canâ€™t beat you, you can only beat yourselves!
@realDonaldTrump	....must stay strong and fight back with vigor. Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country. The losers all want what you have, donâ€™t give it to them. Be strong & prosper, be weak & die! Stay true....
@realDonaldTrump	Bring back @JudgeJeanine Pirro. The Radical Left Democrats, working closely with their beloved partner, the Fake News Media, is using every trick in the book to SILENCE a majority of our Country. They have all out campaigns against @FoxNews hosts who are doing too well. Fox .....

@realDonaldTrump	So it was indeed (just proven in court papers) â€œlast in his classâ€ (Annapolis) John McCain that sent the Fake Dossier to the FBI and Media hoping to have it printed BEFORE the Election. He & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!
@realDonaldTrump	Report: Christopher Steele backed up his Democrat & Crooked Hillary paid for Fake & Unverified Dossier with information he got from â€œsend in watchersâ€ of low ratings CNN. This is the info that got us the Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	....Should Federal Election Commission and/or FCC look into this? There must be Collusion with the Democrats and, of course, Russia! Such one sided media coverage, most of it Fake News. Hard to believe I won and am winning. Approval Rating 52%, 93% with Republicans. Sorry!  #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	Itâ€™s truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live, not funny/no talent, can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over & over, without so much of a mention of â€œthe other side.â€ Like an advertisement without consequences. Same with Late Night Shows......
@realDonaldTrump	While the press doesnâ€™t like writing about it, nor do I need them to, I donate my yearly Presidential salary of $400,000.00 to different agencies throughout the year, this to Homeland Security.

@realDonaldTrump	GDP growth during the four quarters of 2018 was the fastest since 2005. This Administration is the first on record to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office. GROWTH is beating MARKET EXPECTATIONS!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! A Suffolk/USA Today Poll, just out, states, â€œ50% of Americans AGREE that  Robert Muellerâ€™s investigation is a Witch Hunt.â€ @MSNBC  Very few think it is legit! We will soon find out?
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in New Zealand. They will have to work very hard to prove that one. So Ridiculous!
@realDonaldTrump	Joe Biden got tongue tied over the weekend when he was unable to properly deliver a very simple line about his decision to run for President. Get used to it, another low I.Q. individual!

@realDonaldTrump	....are all coming back to the U.S. So is everyone else. We now have the best Economy in the World, the envy of all. Get that big, beautiful plant in Ohio open now. Close a plant in China or Mexico, where you invested so heavily pre-Trump, but not in the U.S.A. Bring jobs home!
@realDonaldTrump	General Motors and the UAW are going to start â€œtalksâ€ in September/October. Why wait, start them now! I want jobs to stay in the U.S.A. and want Lordstown (Ohio), in one of the best economies in our history, opened or sold to a company who will open it up fast! Car companies.....

@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are getting very â€œstrange.â€ They now want to change the voting age to 16, abolish the Electoral College, and Increase significantly the number of Supreme Court Justices. Actually, youâ€™ve got to win it at the Ballot Box!

@realDonaldTrump	Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier & different than campaigning for the Electoral College. Itâ€™s like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to....

@realDonaldTrump	We have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs!
@realDonaldTrump	The Republican Party will become the Party of Great HealthCare! ObamaCare is a disaster, far too expensive and deductibility ridiculously high - virtually unusable! Moving forward in Courts and Legislatively!
@realDonaldTrump	Very important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil. World Markets are fragile, price of Oil getting too high. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, ratings for â€œMorning Joe,â€ which were really bad in the first place, just â€œtankedâ€ with the release of the Mueller Report. Likewise, other shows on MSNBC and CNN have gone down by as much as 50%. Just shows, Fake News never wins!
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman Adam Schiff, who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking, should be forced to resign from Congress!
@realDonaldTrump	FBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise, Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years, and do Nothing. The Dems donâ€™t care, such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They are suffering a major â€œbreakdown,â€ have ZERO credibility or respect, & must be thinking about going legit. I have learned to live with Fake News, which has never been more corrupt than it is right now. Someday, I will tell you the secret!

@realDonaldTrump	So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!
@realDonaldTrump	...The problem is, no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get, no matter what we give them, it will never be enough. Just watch, they will Harass & Complain & Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO, weâ€™ve got a Country to run!
@realDonaldTrump	Robert Mueller was a Hero to the Radical Left Democrats, until he ruled that there was No Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous to even say!). After more than two years since the â€œinsurance policyâ€ statement was made by a dirty cop, I got the answers I wanted, the Truth.....
@realDonaldTrump	Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, & Stock Market, would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!
@realDonaldTrump	....the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and â€œtalk.â€ Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!
@realDonaldTrump	....through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesnâ€™t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING.....
@realDonaldTrump	The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S....

@realDonaldTrump	It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws. In less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved. But the Dems donâ€™t care about the crime, they donâ€™t want any victory for Trump and the Republicans, even if good for USA!

@realDonaldTrump	Robert Mueller was a God-like figure to the Democrats, until he ruled No Collusion in the long awaited $30,000,000 Mueller Report. Now the Dems donâ€™t even acknowledge his name, have become totally unhinged, and would like to go through the whole process again. It wonâ€™t happen!

@realDonaldTrump	Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesnâ€™t work. Premiums & deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. The Republicans.....

@realDonaldTrump	Congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the Border! If no action, Border, or large sections of Border, will close. This is a National Emergency!
@realDonaldTrump	...This will be a great campaign issue. I never asked Mitch McConnell for a vote before the Election as has been incorrectly reported (as usual) in the @nytimes, but only after the Election when we take back the House etc. Republicans will always support pre-existing conditions!
@realDonaldTrump	I was never planning a vote prior to the 2020 Election on the wonderful HealthCare package that some very talented people are now developing for me & the Republican Party. It will be on full display during the Election as a much better & less expensive alternative to ObamaCare...

@realDonaldTrump	The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!
@realDonaldTrump	There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy. This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	According to polling, few people seem to care about the Russian Collusion Hoax, but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive. They should focus on legislation or, even better, an investigation of how the ridiculous Collusion Delusion got started - so illegal!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed, the Economy is looking very strong, the China and USMCA deals are moving along nicely, there is little or no Inflation, and USA optimism is very high!
@realDonaldTrump	THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS THE PARTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM!

@realDonaldTrump	....This will supersede USMCA. Likewise I am looking at an economic penalty for the 500 Billion Dollars in illegal DRUGS that are shipped and smuggled through Mexico and across our Southern Border. Over 100,00 Americans die each year, sooo many families destroyed!
@realDonaldTrump	....However, if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesnâ€™t work, which it will, I will close the Border.......
@realDonaldTrump	The Crazed and Dishonest Washington Post again purposely got it wrong. Mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at THEIR Southern Border, before the long march up to the U.S. This is great and the way it should be. The big flow will stop.......

@realDonaldTrump	....In the meantime, the Democrats in Congress must help the Republicans (we need their votes) to end the horrible, costly and foolish loopholes in our Immigration Laws. Once that happens, all will be smooth. We can NEVER allow Open Borders!
@realDonaldTrump	....itâ€™s powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S., and removing them back to their country of origin. Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous & massive migration, we will be focusing on Border Security, not Ports of Entry....
@realDonaldTrump	We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Borderâ€™s specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States. This will cause traffic & commercial delays until such time as Mexico is able to use....

@realDonaldTrump	....When I won the Election in 2016, the @nytimes had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the Election (and me) so badly. They didnâ€™t have a clue, it was pathetic. They even apologized to me. But now they are even worse, really corrupt reporting!
@realDonaldTrump	The New York Times Sanctuary Cities/Immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact. They never call to check for truth. Their sources often donâ€™t even exist, a fraud. They will lie & cheat anyway possible to make me look bad. In 6 years they will be gone........

@realDonaldTrump	Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the State of California, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats must change the Immigration Laws FAST. If not, Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants - and this includes Gang Members, Drug Dealers, Human Traffickers, and Criminals of all shapes, sizes and kinds. CHANGE THE LAWS NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	....So interesting to see the Mayor of Oakland and other Sanctuary Cities NOT WANT our currently â€œdetained immigrantsâ€ after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule.

@realDonaldTrump	The Washington Post and New York Times are, in my opinion, two of the most dishonest media outlets around. Truly, the Enemy of the People! https://twitter.com/Liz_Wheeler/status/1119228575134015489Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	....big, fat, waste of time, energy and money - $30,000,000 to be exact. It is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes, perhaps even Spying or Treason. This should never happen again!
@realDonaldTrump	...agreed to testify, it was not necessary for me to respond to statements made in the â€œReportâ€ about me, some of which are total bullshit & only given to make the other person look good (or me to look bad). This was an Illegally Started Hoax that never should have happened, a...
@realDonaldTrump	Statements are made about me by certain people in the Crazy Mueller Report, in itself written by 18 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, which are fabricated & totally untrue. Watch out for people that take so-called â€œnotes,â€ when the notes never existed until needed. Because I never....
@realDonaldTrump	Kimberley Strassel should get the Pulitzer. She is a treasure (and I donâ€™t know her) who correctly called the Russia Hoax right from the start! Others who were soooo wrong will get the Prize. Fake News! https://twitter.com/KimStrassel/status/1119039985431113728Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe Mueller Report is perhaps the single most humiliating thing that has ever happened to the White House Press in the history of this Country. They know they lied...Many reporters lied about Russia Collusion and so much more. Clapper & Brennan, all liesâ€ @TuckerCarlson
@realDonaldTrump	â€œIf dozens of Federal prosecutors spent two years trying to charge you with a crime, and found they couldnâ€™t, it would mean there wasnâ€™t any evidence you did it - and thatâ€™s what happened here - thatâ€™s what we just learned from the Mueller Report.â€  @TuckerCarlson
@realDonaldTrump	Good night of television! 8:00 PM @WattersWorld  9:00 PM @JudgeJeanine with interview of @RudyGiuliani followed by Greg G. Honest commentary is always nice!

@realDonaldTrump	The end result of the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history is No Collusion with Russia (and No Obstruction). Pretty Amazing!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the Mueller Report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA. The Russia Hoax is dead!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite the fact that the Mueller Report should not have been authorized in the first place & was written as nastily as possible by 13 (18) Angry Democrats who were true Trump Haters, including highly conflicted Bob Mueller himself, the end result is No Collusion, No Obstruction!
@realDonaldTrump	How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Can you believe that I had to go through the worst and most corrupt political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States (No Collusion) when it was the â€œother sideâ€ that illegally created the diversionary & criminal event and even spied on my campaign? Disgraceful!
@realDonaldTrump	Jobless claims in the United States have reached their lowest (BEST) level in over 50 years!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite No Collusion, No Obstruction, The Radical Left Democrats do not want to go on to Legislate for the good of the people, but only to Investigate and waste time. This is costing our Country greatly, and will cost the Dems big time in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	The Trump Haters and Angry Democrats who wrote the Mueller Report were devastated by the No Collusion finding! Nothing but a total â€œhit jobâ€ which should never have been allowed to start in the first place!
@realDonaldTrump	Do you believe this? The New York Times Op-Ed: MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS OWE TRUMP AN APOLOGY. Well, they got that one right!
@realDonaldTrump	138 people have been killed in Sri Lanka, with more that 600 badly injured, in a terrorist attack on churches and hotels. The United States offers heartfelt condolences to the great people of Sri Lanka. We stand ready to help!
@realDonaldTrump	Happy Easter! I have never been happier or more content because your Country is doing so well, with an Economy that is the talk of the World and may be stronger than it has ever been before. Have a great day!

@realDonaldTrump	Isnâ€™t it amazing that the people who were closest to me, by far, and knew the Campaign better than anyone, were never even called to testify before Mueller. The reason is that the 18 Angry Democrats knew they would all say â€˜NO COLLUSIONâ€™ and only very good things!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œA very exculpatory section of the Mueller Report: NO CONSPIRACY, COORDINATION or COLLUSION with the Trump Campaign and the Russians. You canâ€™t be more clear than that!â€ @GreggJarrett pic.twitter.com/bcFCtD0DRP

@realDonaldTrump	Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment. There were no crimes by me (No Collusion, No Obstruction), so you canâ€™t impeach. It was the Democrats that committed the crimes, not your Republican President! Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Saudi Arabia and others in OPEC will more than make up the Oil Flow difference in our now Full Sanctions on Iranian Oil. Iran is being given VERY BAD advice by @JohnKerry and people who helped him lead the U.S. into the very bad Iran Nuclear Deal. Big violation of Logan Act?

@realDonaldTrump	The Wall is being rapidly built! The Economy is GREAT! Our Country is Respected again!
@realDonaldTrump	.....But should be much higher than that if Twitter wasnâ€™t playing their political games. No wonder Congress wants to get involved - and they should. Must be more, and fairer, companies to get out the WORD!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe best thing ever to happen to Twitter is Donald Trump.â€ @MariaBartiromo  So true, but they donâ€™t treat me well as a Republican. Very discriminatory, hard for people to sign on. Constantly taking people off list. Big complaints from many people. Different names-over 100 M.....
@realDonaldTrump	â€œHarley Davidson has struggled with Tariffs with the EU, currently paying 31%. Theyâ€™ve had to move production overseas to try and offset some of that Tariff that theyâ€™ve been hit with which will rise to 66% in June of 2021.â€ @MariaBartiromo So unfair to U.S. We will Reciprocate!
@realDonaldTrump	....Dumb and Sick. A really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse. CNN has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster. In fact, it rewarded Chris Cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot, despite his massive failure in the morning. Only on CNN!
@realDonaldTrump	Sorry to say but @foxandfriends is by far the best of the morning political shows on television. It rightfully has BY FAR the highest  ratings, not even close. Morning Psycho (Joe), who helped get me elected in 2016 by having me on (free) all the time, has nosedived, too Angry...
@realDonaldTrump	In the â€œold daysâ€ if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. Remember, â€œItâ€™s the economy stupid.â€ Today I have, as President, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media, it means NOTHING. But it will!
@realDonaldTrump	The Radical Left Democrats, together with their leaders in the Fake News Media, have gone totally insane! I guess that means that the Republican agenda is working. Stay tuned for more!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be going to Green Bay, Wisconsin, for a really big Rally on Saturday Evening. Big crowd expected, much to talk about. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger &  better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!
@realDonaldTrump	Paul Krugman, of the Fake News New York Times, has lost all credibility, as has the Times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash, Only Record Highs!
@realDonaldTrump	The Great State of Tennessee is so close to passing School Choice. All of our Nationâ€™s children, regardless of background, deserve a shot at achieving the American Dream! Time to get this done, so important!

@realDonaldTrump	Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is correct, the VA is not broken, it is doing great. But that is only because of the Trump Administration. We got Veterans Choice & Accountability passed. â€œPresident Trump deserves a lot of credit.â€ Dan Caldwell, Concerned Veterans of America
@realDonaldTrump	I didnâ€™t call Bob Costa of the Washington Post, he called me (Returned his call)!  Just more Fake News.
@realDonaldTrump	....Congress has no time to legislate, they only want to continue the Witch Hunt, which I have already won. They should start looking at The Criminals who are already very well known to all. This was a Rigged System - WE WILL DRAIN THE SWAMP!
@realDonaldTrump	No Collusion, No Obstruction - there has NEVER been a President who has been more transparent. Millions of pages of documents were given to the Mueller Angry Dems, plus I allowed everyone to testify, including W.H. counsel. I didnâ€™t have to do this, but now they want more.....
@realDonaldTrump	Can anyone comprehend what a GREAT job Border Patrol and Law Enforcement is doing on our Southern Border. So far this year they have APPREHENDED 418,000 plus illegal immigrants, way up from last year. Mexico is doing very little for us. DEMS IN CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	.....are there no â€œHigh Crimes and Misdemeanors,â€ there are no Crimes by me at all. All of the Crimes were committed by Crooked Hillary, the Dems, the DNC and Dirty Cops - and we caught them in the act! We waited for Mueller and WON, so now the Dems look to Congress as last hope!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mueller Report, despite being written by Angry Democrats and Trump Haters, and with unlimited money behind it ($35,000,000), didnâ€™t lay a glove on me. I DID NOTHING WRONG. If the partisan Dems ever tried to Impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court. Not only......
@realDonaldTrump	Mexicoâ€™s Soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard Soldiers, probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the Border. Better not happen again! We are now sending ARMED SOLDIERS to the Border. Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending & returning!
@realDonaldTrump	A very big Caravan of over 20,000 people started up through Mexico. It has been reduced in size by Mexico but is still coming. Mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the Border & call up the Military. The Coyotes & Cartels have weapons!
@realDonaldTrump	The American people deserve to know who is in this Country. Yesterday, the Supreme Court took up the Census Citizenship question, a really big deal. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œFormer CIA analyst Larry Johnson accuses United Kingdom Intelligence of helping Obama Administration Spy on the 2016 Trump Presidential Campaign.â€ @OANN WOW! It is now just a question of time before the truth comes out, and when it does, it will be a beauty!

@realDonaldTrump	Welcome to the race Sleepy Joe. I only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. It will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. But if you make it, I will see you at the Starting Gate!
@realDonaldTrump	.....Despite the fact that the Mueller Report was â€œcomposedâ€ by Trump Haters and Angry Democrats, who had unlimited funds and human resources, the end result was No Collusion, No Obstruction. Amazing!
@realDonaldTrump	....Mueller was NOT fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what I, and many others, say was an illegal investigation (there was no crime), headed by a Trump hater who was highly conflicted, and a group of 18 VERY ANGRY Democrats. DRAIN THE SWAMP!
@realDonaldTrump	As has been incorrectly reported by the Fake News Media, I never told then White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller, even though I had the legal right to do so. If I wanted to fire Mueller, I didnâ€™t need McGahn to do it, I could have done it myself. Nevertheless,....

@realDonaldTrump	Great NRA crowd and enthusiasm in Indiana. Thank you! Leaving now for meetings in the Oval Office.
@realDonaldTrump	Just out: Real GDP for First Quarter grew 3.2% at an annual rate. This is far above expectations or projections. Importantly, inflation VERY LOW. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Heading to Indianapolis to speak at the big NRA Conference. Love being in Indiana. The @NRA is getting stronger & stronger and doing some really great and important work. Having their powerful support has been vital to #MAGA!
@realDonaldTrump	Weirdo Tom Steyer, who didnâ€™t have the â€œgutsâ€ or money to run for President, is still trying to remain relevant by putting himself on ads begging for impeachment. He doesnâ€™t mention the fact that mine is perhaps the most successful first 2 year presidency in history & NO C OR O!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œPresident Donald J. Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States. 20 hostages, many in impossible circumstances, have been released in last two years. No money was paid.â€ Cheif Hostage Negotiator, USA!
@realDonaldTrump	No money was paid to North Korea for Otto Warmbier, not two Million Dollars, not anything else. This is not the Obama Administration that paid 1.8 Billion Dollars for four hostages, or gave five terroist hostages plus, who soon went back to battle, for traitor Sgt. Bergdahl!

@realDonaldTrump	The New York Times has apologized for the terrible Anti-Semitic Cartoon, but they havenâ€™t apologized to me for this or all of the Fake and Corrupt news they print on a daily basis. They have reached the lowest level of â€œjournalism,â€ and certainly a low point in @nytimes history!
@realDonaldTrump	Bob Mueller was a great HERO to the Radical Left Democrats. Now that the Mueller Report is finished, with a finding of NO COLLUSION & NO OBSTRUCTION (based on a review of Report by our highly respected A.G.), the Dems are going around saying, â€œBob who, sorry, donâ€™t know the man.â€
@realDonaldTrump	The Dues Sucking firefighters leadership will always support Democrats, even though the membership wants me. Some things never change!
@realDonaldTrump	Sleepy Joe Biden is having his first rally in the Great State of Pennsylvania. He obviously doesnâ€™t know that Pennsylvania is having one of the best economic years in its history, with lowest unemployment EVER, a now thriving Steel Industry (that was dead) & great future!........
@realDonaldTrump	The Media (Fake News) is pushing Sleepy Joe hard. Funny, Iâ€™m only here because of Biden & Obama. They didnâ€™t do the job and now you have Trump, who is getting it done - big time!
@realDonaldTrump	Iâ€™ll never get the support of Dues Crazy union leadership, those people who rip-off their membership with ridiculously high dues, medical and other expenses while being paid a fortune. But the members love Trump. They look at our record economy, tax & reg cuts, military etc. WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	....People are fleeing New York State because of high taxes and yes, even oppression of sorts. They didnâ€™t even put up a fight against SALT - could have won. So much litigation. The NRA should leave and fight from the outside of this very difficult to deal with (unfair) State!
@realDonaldTrump	The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G., who are illegally using the Stateâ€™s legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization, & others. It must get its act together quickly, stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS - FAST!
@realDonaldTrump	I spoke at length yesterday to Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, Chabad  of Poway, where I extended my warmest condolences to him and all affected by the shooting in California. What a great guy. He had a least one finger blown off, and all he wanted to do is help others. Very special!

@realDonaldTrump	The Coyotes and Drug Cartels are in total control of the Mexico side of the Southern Border. They have labs nearby where they make drugs to sell into the U.S. Mexico, one of the most dangerous countryâ€™s in the world, must eradicate this problem now. Also, stop the MARCH to U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION. Besides, how can you have Obstruction when not only was there No Collusion (by Trump), but the bad actions were done by the â€œotherâ€ side? The greatest con-job in the history of American Politics!
@realDonaldTrump	Why didnâ€™t President Obama do something about Russia in September (before November Election) when told by the FBI? He did NOTHING, and had no intention of doing anything!
@realDonaldTrump	Congress must change the Immigration Laws now, Dems wonâ€™t act. Wall is being built - 400 miles by end of next year. Mexico must stop the march to Border! @foxandfriends

@realDonaldTrump	Very good call yesterday with President Putin of Russia. Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia, despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media. Look how they have misled you on â€œRussia Collusion.â€ The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!
@realDonaldTrump	Anything in this very interesting world is possible, but I believe that Kim Jong Un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea, & will do nothing to interfere or end it. He also knows that I am with him & does not want to break his promise to me. Deal will happen!
@realDonaldTrump	When will the Radical Left Wing Media apologize to me for knowingly getting the Russia Collusion Delusion story so wrong? The real story is about to happen! Why is @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN, @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter & Facebook. Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!

@realDonaldTrump	For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results. The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday. 325 Billions Dollars....

@realDonaldTrump	The reason for the China pullback & attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to â€œnegotiateâ€ with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats, and thereby continue to ripoff the United States (($500 Billion a year)) for years to come....

@realDonaldTrump	Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS!
@realDonaldTrump	....If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers, far more than China buys now, we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure, Healthcare, or anything else. China would greatly slow down, and we would automatically speed up!
@realDonaldTrump	The average 401(k) balance has SOARED since the bottom of the market - 466%. Wow!
@realDonaldTrump	Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER, not weaker. Just sit back and watch! In the meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the U.S. at the last minute. This is not the Obama Administration, or the Administration of Sleepy Joe, who let China get away with â€œmurder!â€
@realDonaldTrump	Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to new source!
@realDonaldTrump	....agricultural products from our Great Farmers, in larger amounts than China ever did, and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance. In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!
@realDonaldTrump	....The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars. The U.S. only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods & products, a very big imbalance. With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in, we will buy.....
@realDonaldTrump	Talks with China continue in a very congenial manner - there is absolutely no need to rush - as Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods & products. These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S....

@realDonaldTrump	I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!
@realDonaldTrump	....The only problem is that they know I am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in U.S. history, & much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!
@realDonaldTrump	I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky & have a Democrat win - in which case they would continue to rip-off the USA for $500 Billion a year....
@realDonaldTrump	So now the Radical Left Dems donâ€™t talk about Collusion anymore, because the Mueller Report said there was No Collusion, they only want to talk about Obstruction, even though there was No Obstruction or No Crime - except for the crimes committed by the other side!
@realDonaldTrump	I won the 2016 Election partially based on no Tax Returns while I am under audit (which I still am), and the voters didnâ€™t care. Now the Radical Left Democrats want to again relitigate this matter. Make it a part of the 2020 Election!
@realDonaldTrump	Such an easy way to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA. Itâ€™s very simple!
@realDonaldTrump	China is DREAMING that Sleepy Joe Biden, or any of the others, gets elected in 2020. They LOVE ripping off America!
@realDonaldTrump	The â€œConstitutional Crisisâ€ is the Democrats refusing to work. Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border.
@realDonaldTrump	When the Mueller Report came out showing NO Collusion with Russia (of course), it was supposed to be over, back to work for the people. But the Dems have gone â€œnuts,â€ and it has actually gotten worse! Hope the Republicans win back the House in 2020, or little will get done!
@realDonaldTrump	Ever since the Mueller Report showed No Collusion & No Obstruction, the Dems have been working overtime to damage me and the Republican Party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies, and with NO REASON. Thatâ€™s all they want to do - donâ€™t care about anything else!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite two years and millions of dollars spent, the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the Mueller Report were made public. But they knew there was NOTHING even before the Report was started. It is all a big Hoax, the biggest in American history!
@realDonaldTrump	....employment numbers ever, low taxes & regulations, a rebuilt military & V.A., many great new judges, & so much more. But we have had a giant SCAM perpetrated upon our nation, a Witch Hunt, a Treasonous Hoax. That is the Constitutional Crisis & hopefully guilty people will pay!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a â€œConstitutional Crisis.â€ They and their partner, the Fake News Media, are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible. They are a sad JOKE! We may have the strongest Economy in our history, best...
@realDonaldTrump	....We will then spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture), which is a small percentage of total Tariffs received, and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! GREAT! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us & tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-Tariffed countries...

@realDonaldTrump	..There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China, very good for USA! But China has taken so advantage of the U.S. for so many years, that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore, China should not retaliate-will only get worse!
@realDonaldTrump	...completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). Thatâ€™s Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. Thatâ€™s why China wants to make a deal so badly!...
@realDonaldTrump	There is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also, the Tariffs can be.....

@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @foxandfriends, great show this morning and congratulations on your number one (by far) rating. Well deserved!
@realDonaldTrump	I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you donâ€™t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries. Too expensive to buy in China. You had a great deal, almost completed, & you backed out!
@realDonaldTrump	information! As long as President Trump is President, his opposition will use every tool, and misuse every tool available, to make his life miserable.â€ @TomFitton @JudicialWatch @LouDobbs  Sadly, this proves I am doing a great job - Also, Best Economy and Employment Numbers EVER!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œItâ€™s the attack strategy of harass. This is not about the Attorney General, who is very sophisticated & knows it isnâ€™t about him, itâ€™s about trying to destroy President Trump through an assault on his AG for upholding the rule of law. He released a massive amount of......
@realDonaldTrump	....overthrow the President through an illegal coup.â€ (Recommended by previous DOJ) @TomFitton @JudicialWatch
@realDonaldTrump	....and the Democrat National Committee-The Democrat Party apparatus-has been caught using donor Dollars to Collude with Russian Intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent (me). The FBI has no leadership. The Director is protecting the same gang.....that tried to....
@realDonaldTrump	â€œJust another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the Democrats that began during the Obama Administration, continued through the Mueller FBI operation, & now the baton has been passed to Jerry Nadler to continue to abuse power to harass President Trump..
@realDonaldTrump	â€œEven Director James Clapper admits that the FBI actions against the Trump Presidential Campaign do in fact meet the definition of spying, perhaps FBI Director Christopher Wray will be the next to do so.â€ @LouDobbs
@realDonaldTrump	With incredible grit, skill, and pride, the 7,000 workers here at Sempra Energy are helping lead the American Energy Revolution. They are not only making our nation WEALTHIER but they are making America SAFER by building a future of American Energy INDEPENDENCE! pic.twitter.com/Hqn9wEIXo9
@realDonaldTrump	It is great to be here in Hackberry, Louisiana with the incredible men and women who are making America into the energy superpower of the world! https://www.pscp.tv/w/b6sdtjFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MXJtR1BlQnJ5TmJKTmdXt1K4uoQ-a30yuXIlrj6Eg8kNT7V333RGl2cEEox-?t=45sÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Today marks the one-year anniversary of the opening of the United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. Our beautiful embassy stands as a proud reminder of our strong relationship with Israel and of the importance of keeping a promise and standing for the truth.
@realDonaldTrump	When Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan visited with me in the @WhiteHouse two weeks ago, I told him that I would be going to the G20 in Osaka, Japan. I look forward to being with him and other World Leaders!
@realDonaldTrump	Our great Senator (and Star) from the State of Arkansas, @TomCottonAR, has just completed a wonderful book, â€œSacred Duty,â€ about Arlington National Cemetery and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion. On sale today, make it big!
@realDonaldTrump	China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a â€œmatch,â€ it would be game over, we win! In any event, China wants a deal!
@realDonaldTrump	....This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The Farmers have been â€œforgottenâ€ for many years. Their time is now!
@realDonaldTrump	Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now. Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product, the best, but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy......
@realDonaldTrump	....of the tremendous ground we have lost to China on Trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the WTO. It will all happen, and much faster than people think!
@realDonaldTrump	When the time is right we will make a deal with China. My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but, as I have told him many times before, this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesnâ€™t make any sense. We have to be allowed to make up some.....
@realDonaldTrump	Billions of Dollars, and moving jobs back to the USA where they belong. Other countries are already negotiating with us because they donâ€™t want this to happen to them. They must be a part of USA action. This should have been done by our leaders many years ago. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	We can make a deal with China tomorrow, before their companies start leaving so as not to lose USA business, but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal. No way! We are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made. Will be taking in.....
@realDonaldTrump	....so that they will be more competitive for USA buyers. We are now a much bigger economy than China, and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election. We are the â€œpiggy bankâ€ that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of. NO MORE!
@realDonaldTrump	China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them, by almost 500 Billion Dollars, so we are in a fantastic position. Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff. You can also buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China. Many companies are leaving China.....
@realDonaldTrump	In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming! We placed a 25% Tariff on â€œdumpedâ€ steel from China & other countries, and we now have a big and growing industry. We had to save Steel for our defense and auto industries, both of which are coming back strong!
@realDonaldTrump	....Different opinions are expressed and I make a decisive and final decision - it is a very simple process. All sides, views, and policies are covered. Iâ€™m sure that Iran will want to talk soon.
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Washington Post, and even more Fake News New York Times, are writing stories that there is infighting with respect to my strong policy in the Middle East. There is no infighting whatsoever....
@realDonaldTrump	We stand firmly, strongly, and proudly with the incredible men and women of law enforcement.

@realDonaldTrump	With all of the Fake and Made Up News out there, Iran can have no idea what is actually going on!
@realDonaldTrump	It now seems the General Flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge. It would have been impossible for me to know this but, if that was the case, and with me being one of two people who would become president, why was I not told so that I could make a change?
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is hurting our Country with its fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of Iran. It is scattershot, poorly sourced (made up), and DANGEROUS. At least Iran doesnâ€™t know what to think, which at this point may very well be a good thing!
@realDonaldTrump	Will Jerry Nadler ever look into the fact that Crooked Hillary deleted and acid washed 33,000 emails AFTER getting a most powerful demand notice for them from Congress?
@realDonaldTrump	My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences, and this was TREASON!
@realDonaldTrump	New Fox Poll: 58% of people say that the FBI broke the law in investigating Donald J. Trump. @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	DRAIN THE SWAMP!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œWhat happened is that Donald Trump won. Down goes Comey.â€ @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	Will the Democrats give our Country a badly needed immigration win before the election? Good chance!
@realDonaldTrump	All people that are illegally coming into the United States now will be removed from our Country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the laws are changed. Please do not make yourselves too comfortable, you will be leaving soon!
@realDonaldTrump	Border Patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the Southern Border. The bad â€œhombres,â€ of which there are many, are being detained & will be sent home. Those which we release under the ridiculous Catch & Telease loophole, are being registered and will be removed later!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats now realize that there is a National Emergency at the Border and that, if we work together, it can be immediately fixed. We need Democrat votes and all will be well!
@realDonaldTrump	Courts & Dems in Congress, neither of which have a clue, are trying to FORCE migrants into our Country! OUR COUNTRY IS FULL, OUR DETENTION CENTERS, HOSPITALS & SCHOOLS ARE PACKED. Crazy!

@realDonaldTrump	Hard to believe that @FoxNews is wasting airtime on Mayor Pete, as Chris Wallace likes to call him. Fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the Dems. They got dumped from the Democrats boring debates, and they just want in. They forgot the people.....

@realDonaldTrump	Our Economy and Jobs Market is BOOMING, the best in the World and in our Countryâ€™s history - and we have just started!
@realDonaldTrump	With the wonderful College, University and other Graduations taking place all over the USA, there has never been a better time than now to graduate. Best jobs market ever, great housing and financing. Go out there, work hard, & have a GREAT life. You deserve it. Congratulations!
@realDonaldTrump	Watched some of the Fake News Political Shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way. The Mainstream Media should be ashamed of itself - But the good news is that the USA is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception!
@realDonaldTrump	....he would see that it was nevertheless strong on NO COLLUSION and, ultimately, NO OBSTRUCTION...Anyway, how do you Obstruct when there is no crime and, in fact, the crimes were committed by the other side? Justin is a loser who sadly plays right into our opponents hands!
@realDonaldTrump	Never a fan of @justinamash, a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great Republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy. If he actually read the biased Mueller Report, â€œcomposedâ€ by 18 Angry Dems who hated Trump,....

@realDonaldTrump	On this Cuban Independence Day, we stand by the people of Cuba in their quest for freedom, democracy and prosperity. The Cuban regime must end its repression of Cubans & Venezuelans. The United States will not stand idly by as Cuba continues to subvert democracy in the Americas!

No, I built a great business and donâ€™t need banks, but if I did they would be there...and DeutscheBank......
@realDonaldTrump	The Mainstream Media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today. FAKE NEWS is actually the biggest story of all and is the true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! Thatâ€™s why they refuse to cover the REAL Russia Hoax. But the American people are wise to what is going on.....
@realDonaldTrump	....fashioned, but true. When you donâ€™t need or want money, you donâ€™t need or want banks. Banks have always been available to me, they want to make money. Fake Media only says this to disparage, and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources donâ€™t even exist)......
@realDonaldTrump	The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years), and others of the Fake News Media, keep writing phony stories about how I didnâ€™t use many banks because they didnâ€™t want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didnâ€™t need money. Very old

@realDonaldTrump	....In the meantime, my Administration is achieving things that have never been done before, including unleashing perhaps the Greatest Economy in our Countryâ€™s history....
@realDonaldTrump	....But they really want a do-over! You canâ€™t investigate and legislate simultaneously - it just doesnâ€™t work that way. You canâ€™t go down two tracks at the same time. Let Chuck, Nancy, Jerry, Adam and all of the rest finish playing their games....
@realDonaldTrump	So sad that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our Country. They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40M and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America, or get back to work....
@realDonaldTrump	As I have long been saying, and has now been proven out, this is a Witch Hunt against the Republican Party and myself, and it was the other side that caused the problem, not us!
@realDonaldTrump	..BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. Mr. McGahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in Mr. Nadlerâ€™s pseudo-impeachment drama.â€
@realDonaldTrump	â€œHe (Jerry Nadler) wants a show. He wants to use Mr. McGahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the Mueller investigation. YET MR. MUELLER WASNâ€™T OBSTRUCTED IN ANY WAY, HIS COPIOUS REPORT WAS RELEASED FOR ALL TO SEE, & THERE WAS NO COLLUSION..
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe Democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases. They ought to start governing. You know, for a change.â€  Michael Goodwin @newyorkpost
@realDonaldTrump	Everybody, including me, thought that when the 40 Million Dollar Mueller Report was released with No Collusion and No Obstruction (of a crime caused by others), that was the end. But no, the Democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020. Bad for the Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Also, tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing Walls that are in bad condition and ineffective, and bringing them to a very high standard!
@realDonaldTrump	Much of the Wall being built at the Southern Border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new Wall and footings. Problem is, the Haters say that is not a new Wall, but rather a renovation. Wrong, and we must build where most needed....
@realDonaldTrump	Without the ILLEGAL Witch Hunt, my poll numbers, especially because of our historically â€œgreatâ€ economy, would be at 65%. Too bad! The greatest Hoax in American History.
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are getting ZERO work done in Congress. All they are focused on is trying to prove the Mueller Report wrong, the Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	After two years of an expensive and comprehensive Witch Hunt, the Democrats donâ€™t like the result and they want a DO OVER. In other words, the Witch Hunt continues!
@realDonaldTrump	Everything the Democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them, especially when the Mueller Report came back with a NO COLLUSION finding. Now they say Impeach President Trump, even though he did nothin wrong, while they â€œfish!â€
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Governor @MattBevin on winning the Republican Primary for Governor tonight in the Great State of KENTUCKY. Matt, you are doing a fantastic job!
@realDonaldTrump	Great news for Republicans: Fred Keller has just won the hard fought for Pennsylvania Congressional contest in a LANDSLIDE, over 70% of the vote. Thanks to the thousands who showed up for the Rally last night. Congratulations to Fred and his wonderful family!
@realDonaldTrump	John Brennan on the Mueller probe, â€œI donâ€™t know if I received bad information, but I THINK I SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN THERE ACTUALLY WAS.â€ Wow, he admits he was wrong! Congress should go back to work on drug prices etc.
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are on a fishing expedition, wanting to interview the same people, and see the same things, as we just went through for two years with Robert Mueller and the 18 Angry Dems. Never happened to a president before. Never even happened to President Obama!
@realDonaldTrump	After spending 40 Million Dollars, reviewing 1.4 million pages of documents, & interviewing 500 people with the total support of the White House, the Mueller Report was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to the Democrats, so they want a DO OVER. It doesnâ€™t work that way-so bad for our Country!

@realDonaldTrump	When the Democrats in Congress refinish, for the 5th time, their Fake work on their very disappointing Mueller Report finding, they will have the time to get the REAL work of the people done. Move quickly!
@realDonaldTrump	I was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, knowing that they would say I was raging, which they always do, along with their partner, the Fake News Media. Well, so many stories about the meeting use the Rage narrative anyway - Fake & Corrupt Press!
@realDonaldTrump	Rex Tillerson, a man who is â€œdumb as a rockâ€ and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be Secretary of State, made up a story (he got fired) that I was out-prepared by Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Hamburg, Germany. I donâ€™t think Putin would agree. Look how the U.S. is doing!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats have become known as THE DO NOTHING PARTY!
@realDonaldTrump	....drug prices, pre-existing conditions and our great Vets. All they are geared up to do, six committees, is squander time, day after day, trying to find anything which will be bad for me. A pure fishing expedition like this never happened before, & it should never happen again!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are getting nothing done in Congress. All of their effort is about a Re-Do of the Mueller Report, which didnâ€™t turn out the way they wanted. It is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time. Their heart is not into Infrastructure, lower.....
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats donâ€™t want to fix the loopholes at the Border. They donâ€™t want to do anything. Open Borders and crime!
@realDonaldTrump	Zero is getting done with the Democrats in charge of the House. All they want to do is put the Mueller Report behind them and start all over again. No Do-Overs!
@realDonaldTrump	In a letter to her House colleagues, Nancy Pelosi said: â€œPresident Trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see.â€ This is not true. I was purposely very polite and calm, much as I was minutes later with the press in the Rose Garden. Can be easily proven. It is all such a lie!
@realDonaldTrump	.....The Dems want a second shot at Bob Mueller, are very unhappy with the No Collusion Report. They should not be allowed to play this game any longer - no second chances - must get back to work. So bad for our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	....(with many more to come) and 2 Supreme Court Justices - we are getting into record territory! Thank you all and have a great Memorial Day Weekend.
@realDonaldTrump	Mitch McConnell and our Republican Senators have been very solid and strong. We have accomplished a great deal together, in particular with our Courts, 107 Federal Judges....

I was at @ArlingtonNatl yesterday & the people there were so grateful for Tomâ€™s inspiring portrait of â€œThe Old Guard.â€ Great job @TomCottonAR!
@realDonaldTrump	I donâ€™t know why the Radical Left Democrats want Bob Mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 Million Dollar Report that states, loud & clear & for all to hear, No Collusion and No Obstruction (how do you Obstruct a NO crime?) Dems are just looking for trouble and a Do-Over!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œIf they try to Impeach President Trump, who has done nothing wrong (No Collusion), they will end up getting him re-electedâ€ @LindseyGrahamSC Impeachment is for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. There were no High Crimes and Misdemeanors, except for those committed by the other side!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œIntelligence Agencies were used against an American President.â€ @DevinNunes @ShannonBream @FoxNews  This should NEVER happen to a President again! Dems are furious at Robert Mueller for his findings - NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION. Now they should go back to work and legislate!
@realDonaldTrump	When is Twitter going to allow the very popular Conservative Voices that it has so viciously shut down, back into the OPEN? IT IS TIME!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! CNN Ratings are WAY DOWN, record lows. People are getting tired of so many Fake Stories and Anti-Trump lies. Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot - which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon!

@realDonaldTrump	In addition to great incompetence and corruption, The Smollett case in Chicago is also about a Hate Crime.

@realDonaldTrump	Democrat Senator Mark Warner is acting and talking like he is in total control of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Their is nothing bipartisan about him.

@realDonaldTrump	The Great Patriots of Rolling Thunder WILL be coming back to Washington, D.C. next year, & hopefully for many years to come. It is where they want to be, & where they should be. Have a wonderful time today. Thank you to our great men & women of the Pentagon for working it out!

@realDonaldTrump	North Korea fired off some small weapons, which disturbed some of my people, and others, but not me. I have confidence that Chairman Kim will keep his promise to me, & also smiled when he called Swampman Joe Biden a low IQ individual, & worse. Perhaps thatâ€™s sending me a signal?
@realDonaldTrump	Going to play golf right now with @AbeShinzo. Japan loves the game. Tremendous fans of @JackNicklaus, @TigerWoods, and @PhilMickelson â€” I said what about @GaryPlayer, they said we love Gary too!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be making two stops this morning in Japan to visit with our Great Military, then a quick stop in Alaska and back to D.C. Meetings with Prime Minister Abe went very well, and getting to spend time with the new Emperor and Empress of Japan was a great honor!
@realDonaldTrump	Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, & helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!
@realDonaldTrump	....Super Predator was the term associated with the 1994 Crime Bill that Sleepy Joe Biden was so heavily involved in passing. That was a dark period in American History, but has Sleepy Joe apologized? No!

@realDonaldTrump	The Navy put out a disclaimer on the McCain story. Looks like the story was an exaggeration, or even Fake News - but why not, everything else is!
@realDonaldTrump	Yesterday, Border Patrol agents apprehended the largest group of illegal aliens ever: 1,036 people who illegally crossed the border in El Paso around 4am. Democrats need to stand by our incredible Border Patrol and finally fix the loopholes at our Border! pic.twitter.com/6K1rIUzorM

@realDonaldTrump	Robert Mueller came to the Oval Office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the Director of the FBI. He had already been in that position for 12 years, I told him NO. The next day he was named Special Counsel - A total Conflict of Interest. NICE!

Thatâ€™s all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax...And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected. It was a crime that didnâ€™t exist. So now the Dems and their partner, the Fake News Media,.....
@realDonaldTrump	The Greatest Presidential Harassment in history. After spending $40,000,000 over two dark years, with unlimited access, people, resources and cooperation, highly conflicted Robert Mueller would have brought charges, if he had ANYTHING, but there were no charges to bring!

@realDonaldTrump	90% of the Drugs coming into the United States come through Mexico & our Southern Border. 80,000 people died last year, 1,000,000 people ruined. This has gone on for many years & nothing has been done about it. We have a 100 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit with Mexico. Itâ€™s time!
@realDonaldTrump	In order not to pay Tariffs, if they start rising, companies will leave Mexico, which has taken 30% of our Auto Industry, and come back home to the USA. Mexico must take back their country from the drug lords and cartels. The Tariff is about stopping drugs as well as illegals!
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. Mexico makes a FORTUNE from the U.S., have for decades, they can easily fix this problem. Time for them to finally do what must be done!
@realDonaldTrump	Hard to believe that with the Crisis on the Border, the Dems wonâ€™t do the quick and easy fix. Would solve the problem but they want Open Borders, which equals crime!

@realDonaldTrump	Democrats canâ€™t impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats. The facts are â€œpouringâ€ in. The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History! Congress, go back to work and help us at the Border, with Drug Prices and on Infrastructure.
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border. Problem is, theyâ€™ve been â€œtalkingâ€ for 25 years. We want action, not talk. They could solve the Border Crisis in one day if they so desired. Otherwise, our companies and jobs are coming back to the USA!
@realDonaldTrump	Peggy Noonan, the simplistic writer for Trump Haters all, is stuck in the past glory of Reagan and has no idea what is happening with the Radical Left Democrats, or how vicious and desperate they are. Mueller had to correct his ridiculous statement, Peggy never understood it!

@realDonaldTrump	The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly, despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits. What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again!
@realDonaldTrump	....Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants, which they can do very easily, or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border, will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs). America has had enough!
@realDonaldTrump	People have been saying for years that we should talk to Mexico. The problem is that Mexico is an â€œabuserâ€ of the United States, taking but never giving. It has been this way for decades. Either they stop the invasion of our Country by Drug Dealers, Cartels, Human Traffickers....

@realDonaldTrump	Just arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while, I turned it off. All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesnâ€™t owner @ATT do something?
@realDonaldTrump	China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries, including the United States, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking Billions!

@realDonaldTrump	House Democrats, fresh off a Republican victory against them (in Federal Court) on the Wall,  keep asking people to come and testify regarding the No Collusion Witch Hunt. They are very unhappy with the Mueller Report, especially with his corrective letter, & now want a Do Over!

@realDonaldTrump	I kept hearing that there would be â€œmassiveâ€ rallies against me in the UK, but it was quite the opposite. The big crowds, which the Corrupt Media hates to show, were those that gathered in support of the USA and me. They were big & enthusiastic as opposed to the organized flops!
@realDonaldTrump	Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem, but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies, not people, to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up, I mean nobody. You canâ€™t win without people!
@realDonaldTrump	Washed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make â€œyour great presidentâ€ look really bad. She got caught, just like the Fake News Media gets caught. A sick scammer!
@realDonaldTrump	Can you imagine Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer saying out loud, for all to hear, that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep. He would rather have our Country fail with drugs & Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice, no bluff!

@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are incapable of doing a good and solid Immigration Bill!
@realDonaldTrump	If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, & there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm & Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately. If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!
@realDonaldTrump	...and have no intention of doing anything other than going on a fishing expedition to see if they can find anything on me - both illegal & unprecedented in U.S. history. There was no Collusion - Investigate the Investigators! Go to work on Drug Price Reductions & Infrastructure!
@realDonaldTrump	Nervous Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement, especially since I was with foreign leaders overseas. There is no evidence for such a thing to have been said. Nervous Nancy & Dems are getting Zero work done in Congress....
@realDonaldTrump	China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries, including the United States, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking in Billions!

@realDonaldTrump	John Solomon: Factual errors and major omissions in the Mueller Report show that it is totally biased against Trump.
@realDonaldTrump	Watched MSNBC this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week. Such lies, almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth. Fake News! No wonder their ratings, along with CNN, are WAY DOWN. The hatred Comcast has is amazing!
@realDonaldTrump	I would like to thank the President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, together with all of the many representatives of both the United States and Mexico, for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed!
@realDonaldTrump	Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico!
@realDonaldTrump	Nervous Nancy Pelosi & the Democrat House are getting nothing done. Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA, the spectacular & very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA, the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers, Manufacturers & Unions!
@realDonaldTrump	MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico will try very hard, and if they do that, this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!
@realDonaldTrump	Brandon Judd, National Border Patrol Council: â€œThatâ€™s going to be a huge deal because Mexico will be using their strong Immigration Laws - A game changer. People no longer will be released into the U.S.â€ Also, 6000 Mexican Troops at their Southern Border. Currently there are few!
@realDonaldTrump	While the reviews and reporting on our Border Immigration Agreement with Mexico have been very good, there has nevertheless been much false reporting (surprise!) by the Fake and Corrupt News Media, such as Comcast/NBC, CNN, @nytimes & @washingtonpost. These â€œFakersâ€ are Bad News!
@realDonaldTrump	....stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended. Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to....
@realDonaldTrump	The Failing @nytimes story on Mexico and Illegal Immigration through our Southern Border has now been proven shockingly false and untrue, bad reporting, and the paper is embarrassed by it. The only problem is that they knew it was Fake News before it went out. Corrupt Media!
@realDonaldTrump	....No Obstruction. The Dems were devastated - after all this time and money spent ($40,000,000), the Mueller Report was a disaster for them. But they want a Redo, or Do Over. They are even bringing in @CNN sleazebag attorney John Dean. Sorry, no Do Overs - Go back to work!
@realDonaldTrump	For two years all the Democrats talked about was the Mueller Report, because they knew that it was loaded up with 13 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, later increased to 18. But despite the bias, when the Report came out, the findings were No Collusion and facts that led to........
@realDonaldTrump	If President Obama made the deals that I have made, both at the Border and for the Economy, the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible, & a National Holiday would be immediately declared. With me, despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done, no credit!
@realDonaldTrump	Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform, without restriction. Itâ€™s called Freedom of Speech, remember. You are making a Giant Mistake!
@realDonaldTrump	.....there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of Tariffs - But I donâ€™t believe that will be necessary. The Failing @nytimes, & ratings challenged @CNN, will do anything possible to see our Country fail! They are truly The Enemy of the People!
@realDonaldTrump	.....not mentioned in yesterday press release, one in particular, were agreed upon. That will be announced at the appropriate time. There is now going to be great cooperation between Mexico & the USA, something that didnâ€™t exist for decades. However, if for some unknown reason...
@realDonaldTrump	.....Mexico was not being cooperative on the Border in things we had, or didnâ€™t have, and now I have full confidence, especially after speaking to their President yesterday, that they will be very cooperative and want to get the job properly done. Importantly, some things.....
@realDonaldTrump	Another false report in the Failing  @nytimes. We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time, as have other administrations, but were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico. Additionally, and for many years,....
@realDonaldTrump	I know it is not at all â€œPresidentialâ€ to hit back at the Corrupt Media, or people who work for the Corrupt Media, when they make false statements about me or the Trump Administration. Problem is, if you donâ€™t hit back, people believe the Fake News is true. So weâ€™ll hit back!
@realDonaldTrump	....other than to know he was, and is, a total Loser. When he makes statements about me, they are made up, he knows nothing!
@realDonaldTrump	Little @DonnyDeutsch, whose show, like his previous shoebiz tries, is a disaster, has been saying that I had been a friend of his. This is false. He, & separately @ErinBurnett, used to BEG me to be on episodes of the Apprentice (both were bad), but that was it. Hardly knew him,..

@realDonaldTrump	When will the Failing New York Times admit that their front page story on the  the new Mexico deal at the Border is a FRAUD and nothing more than a badly reported â€œhit jobâ€ on me, something that has been going on since the first day I announced for the presidency! Sick Journalism
@realDonaldTrump	....We do not anticipate a problem with the vote but, if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming, Tariffs will be reinstated!
@realDonaldTrump	We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years. It will be revealed in the not too distant future and will need a vote by Mexicoâ€™s Legislative body!..

@realDonaldTrump	On my way to Iowa - just heard nearly 1,000 agriculture groups signed a letter urging Congress to approve the USMCA. Our Patriot Farmers & rural America have spoken! Now Congress must do its job & support these great men and women by passing the bipartisan USMCA Trade Agreement!

@realDonaldTrump	....If Mexico produces (which I think they will). Biggest part of deal with Mexico has not yet been revealed! China is similar, except they devalue currency and subsidize companies to lessen effect of 25% Tariff. So far, little effect to consumer. Companies will relocate to U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	...Companies to come to the U.S.A and to get companies that have left us for other lands to come back home. We stupidly lost 30% of our auto business to Mexico. If the Tariffs went on at the higher level, they would all come back, and pass. But very happy with the deal I made,...
@realDonaldTrump	Maria, Dagan, Steve, Stuart V - When you are the big â€œpiggy bankâ€ that other countries have been ripping off for years (to a level that is not to be believed), Tariffs are a great negotiating tool, a great revenue producers and,  most importantly, a powerful way to get......

@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News has never been more dishonest than it is today. Thank goodness we can fight back on Social Media. Their new weapon of choice is Fake Polling, sometimes referred to as Suppression Polls (they suppress the numbers). Had it in 2016, but this is worse.....

@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News doesnâ€™t report it, but Republican enthusiasm is at an all time   high. Look what is going on in Orlando, Florida, right now! People have never seen anything like it (unless you play a guitar). Going to be wild - See you later!
@realDonaldTrump	European Markets rose on comments (unfair to U.S.) made today by Mario D!
@realDonaldTrump	Mario Draghi just announced more stimulus could come, which immediately dropped the Euro against the Dollar, making it unfairly easier for them to compete against the USA. They have been getting away with this for years, along with China and others.
@realDonaldTrump	Only a few people showed up for the so-called Impeachment rallies over the weekend. The numbers were anemic, no spirit, no hope. More importantly, No Collusion, No Obstruction!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow!  The State Department said it has identified 30 Security Incidents involving current or former employees and their handling of Crooked Hillary Clintonâ€™s Emails. @FoxNews  This is really big. Never admitted before. Highly Classified Material. Will the Dems investigate this?
@realDonaldTrump	The story in the @nytimes about the U.S. escalating attacks on Russiaâ€™s power grid is Fake News, and the Failing New York Times knows it. They should immediately release their sources which, if they exist at all, which I doubt, are phony. Times must be held fully accountable!
@realDonaldTrump	Thousands of people are already lined up in Orlando, some two days before tomorrow nights big Rally. Large Screens and food trucks will be there for those that canâ€™t get into the 25,000 capacity arena. It will be a very exciting evening! Make America Great Again!
@realDonaldTrump	....long before they get to our Southern Border. Guatemala is getting ready to sign a Safe-Third Agreement. The only ones who wonâ€™t do anything are the Democrats in Congress. They must vote to get rid of the loopholes, and fix asylum! If so, Border Crisis will end quickly!
@realDonaldTrump	Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in. Mexico, using their strong immigration laws, is doing a very good job of stopping people.......
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to President Lopez Obrador â€” Mexico voted to ratify the USMCA today by a huge margin. Time for Congress to do the same here!
@realDonaldTrump	Just returning from Orlando and Doral (Miami), Florida, and heading to the Oval Office, where I will present the great Economist, Dr. Arthur Laffer, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed LIVE tonight by @seanhannity on @FoxNews  9 P.M. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	....asking Hillary Clinton why she deleted and acid washed her Emails AFTER getting a subpoena from Congress? Anybody else would be in jail for that, yet the Dems refuse to even bring it up. Rigged House Committee
@realDonaldTrump	So sad that the Democrats are putting wonderful Hope Hicks through hell, for 3 years now, after total exoneration by Robert Mueller & the Mueller Report. They were unhappy with result so they want a Do Over. Very unfair & costly to her. Will it ever end? Why arenâ€™t they.......
@realDonaldTrump	If I didnâ€™t have the Phony Witch Hunt going on for 3 years, and if the Fake News Media and their partner in Crime, the Democrats, would have played it straight, I would be way up in the Polls right now - with our Economy, winning by 20 points. But Iâ€™m winning anyway!
@realDonaldTrump	DEMOCRAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ARE #RIGGED!
@realDonaldTrump	....33,000 Emails that Hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS? That is real Obstruction that the Dems want no part of because their hearings are RIGGED and a disgrace to our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	The Dems are very unhappy with the Mueller Report, so after almost 3 years, they want a Redo, or Do Over. This is extreme Presidential Harassment. They gave Crooked Hillaryâ€™s people complete Immunity, yet now they bring back Hope Hicks. Why arenâ€™t the Dems looking at the.....

@realDonaldTrump	In the ultimate act of moral cowardice, not one Democrat Candidate for president - not a single one - has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ICE and Border Patrol. They donâ€™t have the character, the virtue, or the spine! #Trump2020 pic.twitter.com/oULNnVtxmW
@realDonaldTrump	On no issue are Democrats more extreme â€“ and more depraved â€“ than when it comes to Border Security. The Democrat Agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible. It is the great betrayal of the American Middle Class and our Country as a whole! #Trump2020 pic.twitter.com/f9RJhpp50J

@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe President has a really good story to tell. We have unemployment lower than weâ€™ve seen in decades. We have people who stopped looking for work coming back into the labor force. We are in a record growth period.â€ Michael Steel @MSNBC (do you believe?)
@realDonaldTrump	S&P opens at Record High!
@realDonaldTrump	Since Election Day 2016, Stocks up almost 50%, Stocks gained 9.2 Trillion Dollars in value, and more than 5,000,000 new jobs added to the Economy. @LouDobbs If our opponent had won, there would have been a market crash, plain and simple! @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity @IngrahamAngle
@realDonaldTrump	....proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new,  and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting & more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD!
@realDonaldTrump	....On Monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in International Waters. We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not....
@realDonaldTrump	....Death to America. I terminated deal, which was not even ratified by Congress, and imposed strong sanctions. They are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my Presidency, when they were causing major problems throughout the Middle East. Now they are Bust!....
@realDonaldTrump	President Obama made a desperate and terrible deal with Iran - Gave them 150 Billion Dollars plus I.8 Billion Dollars in CASH! Iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out. Gave them a free path to Nuclear Weapons, and SOON. Instead of saying thank you, Iran yelled.....
@realDonaldTrump	....â€This Russia Collusion Hoax was perpetrated in part by people inside the government, and in part by a compliant (Fake News) media.â€ Mollie Hemingway.  @TuckerCarlson @foxandfriends  The facts are starting to pour out. Stay tuned!
@realDonaldTrump	Just revealed that the Failing and Desperate New York Times was feeding false stories about me, & those associated with me, to the FBI. This shows the kind of unprecedented hatred I have been putting up with for years with this Crooked newspaper. Is what they have done legal?...
@realDonaldTrump	I never called the strike against Iran â€œBACK,â€ as people are incorrectly reporting, I just stopped it from going forward at this time!
@realDonaldTrump	At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border. If not, Deportations start!
@realDonaldTrump	....Sanctions come off Iran, and they become a productive and prosperous nation again - The sooner the better!
@realDonaldTrump	Iran cannot have Nuclear Weapons! Under the terrible Obama plan, they would have been on their way to Nuclear in a short number of years, and existing verification is not acceptable. We are putting major additional Sanctions on Iran on Monday. I look forward to the day that.....
@realDonaldTrump	I am at Camp David working on many things, including Iran! We have a great Economy, Tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge Dollars coming IN, & on helping to make good Trade Deals. The Dow heading to BEST June in 80 years! Stock Market BEST June in 50 years!

@realDonaldTrump	When people come into our Country illegally, they will be DEPORTED!
@realDonaldTrump	The people that Ice will apprehend have already been ordered to be deported. This means that they have run from the law and run from the courts. These are people that are supposed to go back to their home country. They broke the law by coming into the country, & now by staying.
@realDonaldTrump	When our Country had no debt and built everything from Highways to the Military with CASH, we had a big system of Tariffs. Now we allow other countries to steal our wealth, treasure, and jobs - But no more! The USA is doing great, with unlimited upside into the future!
@realDonaldTrump	Wonderful Church service at Camp David. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	I want to give the Democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to Asylum and Loopholes. This will fix the Southern Border, together with the help that Mexico is now giving us. Probably wonâ€™t happen, but worth a try. Two weeks and big Deportation begins!
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce the launch of  http://tmagac.winred.comÂ . This new platform will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine. This has been a priority of mine and Iâ€™m pleased to share that it is up and running! #KeepAmericaGreat
@realDonaldTrump	....Think of what it could have been if the Fed had gotten it right. Thousands of points higher on the Dow, and GDP in the 4â€™s or even 5â€™s. Now they stick, like a stubborn child, when we need rates cuts, & easing, to make up for what other countries are doing against us. Blew it!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite a Federal Reserve that doesnâ€™t know what it is doing - raised rates far too fast (very low inflation, other parts of world slowing, lowering & easing) & did large scale tightening, $50 Billion/month, we are on course to have one of the best Months of June in US history...
@realDonaldTrump	....a dangerous journey. We donâ€™t even need to be there in that the U.S. has just become (by far) the largest producer of Energy anywhere in the world! The U.S. request for Iran is very simple - No Nuclear Weapons and No Further Sponsoring of Terror!
@realDonaldTrump	China gets 91% of its Oil from the Straight, Japan 62%, & many other countries likewise. So why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation. All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been....

@realDonaldTrump	....The wonderful Iranian people are suffering, and for no reason at all. Their leadership spends all of its money on Terror, and little on anything else. The U.S. has not forgotten Iranâ€™s use of IEDâ€™s & EFPâ€™s (bombs), which killed 2000 Americans, and wounded many more...
@realDonaldTrump	Iran leadership doesnâ€™t understand the words â€œniceâ€ or â€œcompassion,â€ they never have. Sadly, the thing they do understand is Strength and Power, and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world, with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone..

@realDonaldTrump	The Republican Senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our Southern Border, 84-8! In addition to aid, Congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the Crisis. We must end incentives for Smuggling Children, Trafficking Women, and Selling Drugs.

@realDonaldTrump	According to Fake News (and low ratings) @CNN, â€œDemocrats say hearings could change impeachment debate.â€ Thatâ€™s because they have lost the impeachment debate (80% say NO), and they are hoping that yet another DO OVER, after 2 1/2 years and $40,000,000, will turn things around....

@realDonaldTrump	Too bad the Dems in Congress wonâ€™t do anything at all about Border Security. They want Open Borders, which means crime. But we are getting it done, including building the Wall! More people than ever before are coming because the USA Economy is so good, the best in history.
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, @FoxNews did great in the ratings. CNN is dead as a door nail

@realDonaldTrump	54% in Poll! I would be at 75% (with our great economy, maybe the best ever) if not for the Phony Witch Hunt and the Fake News Media!
@realDonaldTrump	I am in Japan at the G-20, representing our Country well, but I heard it was not a good day for Sleepy Joe or Crazy Bernie. One is exhausted, the other is nuts - so whatâ€™s the big deal?
@realDonaldTrump	The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election, all the way up to the day that I took office, because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won - a Big Crash!

@realDonaldTrump	The News Reports about the Department of Commerce dropping its quest to put the Citizenship Question on the Census is incorrect or, to state it differently, FAKE! We are absolutely moving forward, as we must, because of the importance of the answer to this question.
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher, his wonderful wife Andrea, and his entire family. You have been through much together. Glad I could help!
@realDonaldTrump	The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth. We own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door (Andrews), all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice!
@realDonaldTrump	China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games - as they have for many years!

@realDonaldTrump	So important for our Country that the very simple and basic â€œAre you a Citizen of the United States?â€ question be allowed to be asked in the 2020 Census. Department of Commerce and the Department of Justice are working very hard on this, even on the 4th of July!

@realDonaldTrump	....and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run. Why donâ€™t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how....

@realDonaldTrump	The Obama Administration built the Cages, not the Trump Administration! DEMOCRATS MUST GIVE US THE VOTES TO CHANGE BAD IMMIGRATION LAWS.
@realDonaldTrump	The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four â€œprogressives,â€ but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing Socialism, hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats!
@realDonaldTrump	....Detention facilities are not Concentration Camps! America has never been stronger than it is now â€“ rebuilt Military, highest Stock Market EVER, lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before. Keep America Great!
@realDonaldTrump	....They are anti-Israel, pro Al-Qaeda, and comment on the 9/11 attack, â€œsome people did something.â€ Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders, which means drugs, crime, human trafficking, and much more....

@realDonaldTrump	If Democrats want to unite around the foul language & racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular & unrepresentative Congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country, the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President, for the foul language they have used, and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!

@realDonaldTrump	Chinaâ€™s 2nd Quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years. The United States Tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave China for non-tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. This is why China wants to make a deal....
@realDonaldTrump	We are doing great Economically as a Country, Number One, despite the Fedâ€™s antiquated policy on rates and tightening. Much room to grow!

@realDonaldTrump	.....Congresswomen, who I truly believe, based on their actions, hate our Country. Get a list of the HORRIBLE things they have said. Omar is polling at 8%, Cortez at 21%. Nancy Pelosi tried to push them away, but now they are forever wedded to the Democrat Party. See you in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I donâ€™t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show â€œweaknessâ€ and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the Democrat.....

@realDonaldTrump	The Democrat Congresswomen have been spewing some of the most vile, hateful, and disgusting things ever said by a politician in the House or Senate, & yet they get a free pass and a big embrace from the Democrat Party. Horrible anti-Israel, anti-USA, pro-terrorist & public.....

Also must stop with the crazy quantitative tightening. We are in a World competition, & winning big,...
@realDonaldTrump	Because of the faulty thought process we have going for us at the Federal Reserve, we pay much higher interest rates than countries that are no match for us economically. In other words, our interest costs are much higher than other countries, when they should be lower. Correct!

@realDonaldTrump	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	The Washington Post Story, about my speech in North Carolina and tweet, with its phony sources who do not exist, is Fake News. The only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm, far greater than the Democrats. Youâ€™ll see in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	Big progress at the Border, but Dems in Congress must change the Immigration Laws for all to be good! End the Loopholes and much more.
@realDonaldTrump	The Great State of West Virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well. When I became President, it was practically shut down and closed for business. Not anymore!

@realDonaldTrump	When we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated Barrier on the Southern Border, something which cannot do the job, the Fake News Media gives us zero credit for building a new Wall. We have replaced many miles of old Barrier with powerful new Walls!

@realDonaldTrump	Going with First Lady to pay our respects to Justice Stevens. Leaving now!
@realDonaldTrump	The Report of Iran capturing CIA spies is totally false. Zero truth. Just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a Religious Regime that is Badly Failing and has no idea what to do. Their Economy is dead, and will get much worse. Iran is a total mess!
@realDonaldTrump	....But the questions should be asked, why were all of Clintonâ€™s people given immunity, and why were the text messages of Peter S and his lover, Lisa Page, deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller, and after we requested them(this is Illegal)?
@realDonaldTrump	Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple. In the end it will be bad for him and the phony Democrats in Congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt. Result of the Mueller Report, NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!...
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mainstream Media is out of control. They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see. It has never been this bad. They have gone bonkers, & no longer care what is right or wrong. This large scale false reporting is sick!
@realDonaldTrump	....except for those stated by me, & â€œreams of paperâ€ were never given to me. It is a made up story meant to demean & belittle. The Post had no sources. The facts remain the same, that we have 4 Radical Left Congresswomen who have said very bad things about Israel & our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	The Amazon Washington Post front page story yesterday was total Fake News. They said â€œAdvisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.â€ Now really, does that sound like me? What advisors, there were no talking points,....
@realDonaldTrump	It is far more costly for the Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does, in the future, turn down! Very inexpensive, in fact productive,  to move now. The Fed raised & tightened far too much & too fast. In other words, they missed it (Big!). Donâ€™t miss it again!
@realDonaldTrump	....as we have done, it could have been soooo much better. Interest rate costs should have been much lower, & GDP & our Countryâ€™s wealth accumulation much higher. Such a waste of time & money. Also, very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in!
@realDonaldTrump	With almost no inflation, our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve. In addition, Quantitative Tightening is continuing, making it harder for our Country to compete. As good.....

@realDonaldTrump	Why didnâ€™t Robert Mueller & his band of 18 Angry Democrats spend any time investigating Crooked Hillary Clinton, Lyinâ€™ & Leakinâ€™ James Comey, Lisa Page and her Psycho lover, Peter S, Andy McCabe, the beautiful Ohr family, Fusion GPS, and many more,  including HIMSELF & Andrew W?
@realDonaldTrump	It was NEVER agreed that Robert Mueller could use one of his many Democrat Never Trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers. This was specifically NOT agreed to, and I would NEVER have agreed to it. The Greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history, by far!
@realDonaldTrump	So Democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime, try pinning it on a very innocent President, and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our Country, they call It Obstruction? Wrong! Why didnâ€™t Robert Mueller investigate the investigators?
@realDonaldTrump	So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. Whatâ€™s this all about? His lawyer represented the â€œbasement server guyâ€ who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case. This should NOT be allowed. Rigged Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	The young leaders here today (@TPUSA) are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation. It is a movement about reclaiming YOUR future, rebuilding YOUR Country, restoring YOUR destiny, and renewing the values that are the true source of American GREATNESS! pic.twitter.com/unURpLS8Lc
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce the House has passed our budget deal 284-149. Great for our Military and our Vets. A big thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesnâ€™t seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem! #FreeRocky
@realDonaldTrump	Very disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven for being unable to act. Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States. I watched the tapes of A$AP Rocky, and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers. Treat Americans fairly! #FreeRocky
@realDonaldTrump	...What took place was completely unacceptable, and will not be tolerated. Bill de Blasio should act immediately!
@realDonaldTrump	We love our Law Enforcement Officers all around this great Country. What took place in NYC with water being tossed on NYPD officers was a total disgrace. It is time for @NYCMayor @BilldeBlasio to STAND UP for those who protect our lives and serve us all so well...

@realDonaldTrump	Mark Levin will be on @foxandfriends now! Great guy.
@realDonaldTrump	President Trumpâ€™s Approval Rating on Economy is at 52%, a 4 point jump. Fox Poll @foxandfriends  Shouldnâ€™t this be at 100%? Best stock market, economy and unemployment numbers ever! Most people working within U.S. ever! Low interest rates, very low inflation! Country doing great!
@realDonaldTrump	Fox Poll say best Economy in DECADES!
@realDonaldTrump	...impeachment, you have a Party of one. Itâ€™s over.â€ @kilmeade  â€œNancy said, Jerry, please sit down. Very bad idea.

@realDonaldTrump	â€œYesterday changed everything, it really did clear the President. He wins.â€ @ainsleyearhardt  â€œIt changed everything in favor of the President, who said all along this investigation is rooted in nothing. Mueller was exposed as being best friends with Comey.

@realDonaldTrump	There may or may not be National Security concerns with regard to Google and their relationship with China. If there is a problem, we will find out about it. I sincerely hope there is not!!!
@realDonaldTrump	....the fact that I have gone through a three year vicious Witch Hunt, perpetrated by the Lamestream Media in Collusion with Crooked and the Democrat Party, there can be NO WAY, with the greatest Economy in U.S. history, that I can be losing to the Sleepy One. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
@realDonaldTrump	.@FoxNews is at it again. So different from what they used to be during the 2016 Primaries, & before - Proud Warriors! Now new Fox Polls, which have always been terrible to me (they had me losing BIG to Crooked Hillary), have me down to Sleepy Joe. Even considering.....

@realDonaldTrump	NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION, TOTAL EXONERATION. DEMOCRAT WITCH HUNT!
@realDonaldTrump	We gave Nadler and his Trump hating Dems the complete Mueller Report (we didnâ€™t have to), and even Mueller himself, but now that both were a total BUST, they say it wasnâ€™t good enough. Nothing will ever be good enough for them. Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Elijah Cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through â€œOversight.â€ He does NOTHING for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district! Take a look.... #BlacksForTrump2020 https://twitter.com/w_terrence/status/1155168907654774784Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats donâ€™t care about Border Security. They refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the Loopholes and Asylum. Would be so easy! They want Open Borders, which means CRIME,CRIME,CRIME!
@realDonaldTrump	Such a big victory of our Country! â€œSupreme Court approves Trump Administration plan to use Military Funds for the Wall.â€ @FoxNews  We will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure, over time, by other countries.
@realDonaldTrump	The Dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible Mueller performance, and are starting to spin impeachment all over again. How sick & disgusting and bad for our Country are they. What they are doing is so wrong, but they do it anyway. Dems have become the do nothing Party!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly & irrevocably tarnished Witch Hunt Hoax until Robert Mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude & incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen. Truth is, he had no facts on his side. Nothing he could do!
@realDonaldTrump	Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!
@realDonaldTrump	Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States. No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!
@realDonaldTrump	....As proven last week during a Congressional tour, the Border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place
@realDonaldTrump	Rep, Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men & women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border, when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA......

@realDonaldTrump	Under the Trump Administration, African American unemployment is the lowest (best) in the history of the United States. No President has come close to doing this before! I also created successful Opportunity Zones. Waiting for Nancy and Elijah to say, â€œThank you, Mr. President!â€
@realDonaldTrump	If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and Baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical â€œoversightâ€ is a joke!
@realDonaldTrump	There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œElijah Cummings has had his chance to address it (crime & conditions in Baltimore) for decades, and he hasnâ€™t gotten it done.â€ @PeteHegseth @foxandfriends  How can he get it done when he just wants to use his Oversight Committee to hurt innocent people and divide our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Speaking of failing badly, has anyone seen what is happening to Nancy Pelosiâ€™s district in San Francisco. It is not even recognizeable lately. Something must be done before it is too late. The Dems should stop wasting time on the Witch Hunt Hoax and start focusing on our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	....a look, the facts speak far louder than words! The Democrats always play the Race Card, when in fact they have done so little for our Nationâ€™s great African American people. Now, lowest unemployment in U.S. history, and only getting better. Elijah Cummings has failed badly!
@realDonaldTrump	Someone please explain to Nancy Pelosi, who was recently called racist by those in her own party, that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that Congressman Elijah Cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the City of Baltimore. Just take...

@realDonaldTrump	The real Collusion, the Conspiracy, the Crime, was between the Clinton Campaign, the DNC, Fusion GPS, Christopher Steele.....(and many others including Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page and her lover, Ohr and his wonderful wife, and on and on!). @replouiegohmert
@realDonaldTrump	So sad that Elijah Cummings has been able to do so little for the people of Baltimore. Statistically, Baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. Cummings has done nothing but milk Baltimore dry, but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!
@realDonaldTrump	....Robert Muellerâ€™s testimony, and the Mueller Report itself, was a disaster for this illegal Democrat inspired Witch Hunt. It is an embarrassment to the USA that they donâ€™t know how to stop. They canâ€™t help themselves, they are totally lost, they are Clowns!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œOne of the biggest things to come out of Muellerâ€™s testimony was the fact that when he was asked, was there ANYTHING that impeded your investigation, the answer was a clear, unequivocal, NO.â€ Misty Marris  @FoxNews  True, but many other great â€œexoneratingâ€ things came out.....

@realDonaldTrump	The Fed â€œraisedâ€ way too early and way too much. Their quantitative tightening was another big mistake. While our Country is doing very well, the potential wealth creation that was missed, especially when measured against our debt, is staggering. We are competing with other.....
@realDonaldTrump	....even to new heights of success and glory, but not with King Elijah and that crew. When the leaders of Baltimore want to see the City rise again, I am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call!
@realDonaldTrump	Crazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY! Based on that statement, I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist, just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard! The fact is, Baltimore can be brought back, maybe......
@realDonaldTrump	The E.U. and China will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems, making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. In the meantime, and with very low inflation, our Fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison. Too bad!
@realDonaldTrump	Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. He would say, â€œitâ€™s a personal favor to me.â€ Seldom, but sometimes, I would go. It was fine. He came to my office in T.T. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. Just a conman at work!
@realDonaldTrump	If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left â€œSquadâ€ and King Elijahâ€™s Baltimore Fail, it will be a long road to 2020. The good news for the Dems is that they have the Fake News Media in their pocket!

@realDonaldTrump	..My team is negotiating with them now, but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit. They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe. Then they could make a GREAT deal, like in past 30 years, and continue
@realDonaldTrump	China is doing very badly, worst year in 27 - was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now - no signs that they are doing so. That is the problem with China, they just donâ€™t come through. Our Economy has become MUCH larger than the Chinese Economy is last 3 years....

@realDonaldTrump	Baltimoreâ€™s numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years, but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!
@realDonaldTrump	Elijah Cummings never even went to the Southern Border and then he screams at the very good people who, despite Congresses failure to fix the Loopholes and Asylum, make it work (crossings are way down and the Wall is being built). Even with zero Dem help, Border getting strong!

@realDonaldTrump	Things are going along very well with China. They are paying us Tens of Billions of Dollars, made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going. So far our consumer is paying nothing - and no inflation. No help from Fed!
@realDonaldTrump	Countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate REAL trade deals, not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations. They donâ€™t want to be targeted for Tariffs by the U.S.

@realDonaldTrump	God bless the people of El Paso, Texas. God bless the people of Dayton, Ohio.
@realDonaldTrump	The FBI, local and state law enforcement are working together in El Paso and in Dayton, Ohio. Information is rapidly being accumulated in Dayton. Much has already be learned in El Paso. Law enforcement was very rapid in both instances. Updates will be given throughout the day!
@realDonaldTrump	....Melania and I send our heartfelt thoughts and prayers to the great people of Texas.
@realDonaldTrump	Todayâ€™s shooting in El Paso, Texas, was not only tragic, it was an act of cowardice. I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn todayâ€™s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people....

@realDonaldTrump	China is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of Billions of Dollars they have been taking from the U.S. with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation. So one-sided, it should have been stopped many years ago!
@realDonaldTrump	....used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories, hurt our jobs, depress our workersâ€™ wages and harm our farmersâ€™ prices. Not anymore!
@realDonaldTrump	Based on the historic currency manipulation by China, it is now even more obvious to everyone that Americans are not paying for the Tariffs â€“ they are being paid for compliments of China, and the U.S. is taking in tens of Billions of Dollars! China has always....
@realDonaldTrump	China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. Itâ€™s called â€œcurrency manipulation.â€ Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!
@realDonaldTrump	The Media has a big responsibility to life and safety in our Country. Fake News has contributed greatly to the anger and rage that has built up over many years. News coverage has got to start being fair, balanced and unbiased, or these terrible problems will only get worse!

@realDonaldTrump	Maggie Haberman of the Failing @nytimes reported that I was annoyed by the lack of cameras inside the hospitals in Dayton & El Paso, when in fact I was the one who stated, very strongly, that I didnâ€™t want the Fake News inside & told my people NOT to let them in. Fake reporting!

@realDonaldTrump	..TV talent. Then, during the 2016 Election, I would watch as Joe Scarborough & his very angry Psycho wife(?) would push Donny to the point of total humiliation. He would never fight back because he wanted to stay on TV, even on a very low rated show, all in the name of ambition!
@realDonaldTrump	So funny to watch Little Donny Deutsch on TV with his own failing show.

@realDonaldTrump	We are winning, big time, against China. Companies & jobs are fleeing. Prices to us have not gone up, and in some cases, have come down. China is not our problem, though Hong Kong is not helping. Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much & too fast. Now too slow to cut....

@realDonaldTrump	Wow! The Deputy Editor of the Failing New York Times was just demoted. Should have been Fired! Totally biased and inaccurate reporting. The paper is a Fraud, Zero Credibility. Fake News takes another hit, but this time a big one!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Great Farmers know how important it is to win on Trade. They will be the big winners!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States is now, by far, the Biggest, Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World, it is not even close! As others falter, we will only get stronger. Consumers are in the best shape ever, plenty of cash. Business Optimism is at an All Time High!
@realDonaldTrump	If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem. I have no doubt! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1161774305895694336Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit. They hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!
@realDonaldTrump	The Philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets. He had a long and very dangerous criminal record. Looked like he was having a good time after his capture, and after wounding so many police. Long sentence - must get much tougher on street crime!
@realDonaldTrump	....what they were doing. Thereâ€™s plenty of indication, we donâ€™t have to speculate.â€ @SteveDoocy â€œHoly cow, got to read this book.â€ @ainsleyearhardt â€œWOW!â€  @foxandfriends  A very serious situation. Can never be allowed to happen again! DRAIN THE SWAMP
@realDonaldTrump	Go out and get Andrew McCarthyâ€™s new book, â€œBall of Collusion.â€ â€œSupervision became the investigator, and when they pushed the envelope, there was nobody there to tell them NO. It goes right to the President (Obama). Plenty of information that Obama was informed & knew exactly...

@realDonaldTrump	Having dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple. They will be spending vast sums of money in the U.S. Great!
@realDonaldTrump	Just completed a very good meeting on Afghanistan. Many on the opposite side of this 19 year war, and us, are looking to make a deal - if possible!
@realDonaldTrump	I donate 100% of my Presidentâ€™s salary, $400,000, back to our Country, and feel very good about it! https://twitter.com/JuddPDeere45/status/1162445450273800192Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Like it or not, Tlaib and Omar are fast becoming the face of the Democrat Party. Cortez (AOC) is fuming, not happy about this!
@realDonaldTrump	Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted, whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaibâ€™s grandmother. She doesnâ€™t have to see her now!
@realDonaldTrump	Israel was very respectful & nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib, allowing her permission to visit her â€œgrandmother.â€ As soon as she was granted permission, she grandstanded & loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!
@realDonaldTrump	Senator Jim Risch of the Great State of Idaho has been an incredible supporter of our Agenda! He is tough on Crime, Strong on Borders, and will continue to fight for our Second Amendment. Jim will never let you down. He has my Full and Complete Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Patrick Yoes for his election as National President of the great Fraternal Order of Police. Together we will fight for our incredible Law Enforcement Officers!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to my good friend Chuck Canterbury for 16 years of service to the Fraternal Order of Police and our great men and women in blue. You are an incredible patriot!

@realDonaldTrump	Major consideration is being given to naming ANTIFA an â€œORGANIZATION OF TERROR.â€ Portland is being watched very closely. Hopefully the Mayor will be able to properly do his job!
@realDonaldTrump	Biggest crowd EVER, according to Arena people. Thousands outside trying to get in. Place was packed! Radical Left Dems & their Partner, LameStream Media, saying Arena empty. Check out pictures. Fake News. The Enemy of the People! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1162195296924946433Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Look at the tremendous overflow at packed arena in New Hampshire last night. Sorry we couldnâ€™t get you in, will be back soon! pic.twitter.com/Rvd2TeJrpo
@realDonaldTrump	Great time in New Hampshire last night. Placed was maxed out, totally packed, with thousands coming to the arena floor at start. Thousands more outside that were not allowed in per code. Energy was really great to see. We will win New Hampshire in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	The New York Times will be out of business soon after I leave office, hopefully in 6 years. They have Zero credibility and are losing a fortune, even now, especially after their massive unfunded liability. Iâ€™m fairly certain theyâ€™ll endorse me just to keep it all going!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @TedCruz, I couldnâ€™t agree more! https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1163137145218973696Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	House Democrats want to take action against Israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it & the Israeli people. Dems have such disdain for Israel! What happened? AOC Plus 4 is the new face of the Democrat Party!
@realDonaldTrump	Our economy is the best in the world, by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA!
@realDonaldTrump	Juan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic, and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby, he couldnâ€™t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. Yet he is always nasty and wrong!
@realDonaldTrump	We are doing very well with China, and talking!

@realDonaldTrump	With all that this Administration has accomplished, think what my Poll Numbers would be if we had an honest Media, which we do not!
@realDonaldTrump	.....â€Journalismâ€ has reached a new low in the history of our Country. It is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the Democrat Party. The reporting is so false, biased and evil that it has now become a very sick joke...But the public is aware! #CROOKEDJOURNALISM
@realDonaldTrump	The Failing New York Times, in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history, got caught by a leaker that they are shifting  from their Phony Russian Collusion Narrative (the Mueller Report & his testimony were a total disaster), to a Racism Witch Hunt.....
@realDonaldTrump	Great discussion with Prime Minister @BorisJohnson today. We talked about Brexit and how we can move rapidly on a US-UK free trade deal. I look forward to meeting with Boris this weekend, at the @G7, in France!
@realDonaldTrump	Spoke to my two good friends, Prime Minister Modi of India, and Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan, regarding Trade, Strategic Partnerships and, most importantly, for India and Pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in Kashmir. A tough situation, but good conversations!

@realDonaldTrump	Wow, Report Just Out! Google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for Hillary Clinton in 2016 Election! This was put out by a Clinton supporter, not a Trump Supporter! Google should be sued. My victory was even bigger than thought! @JudicialWatch
@realDonaldTrump	.....The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to â€œwillâ€ the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election.  Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world...

@realDonaldTrump	Anthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable â€œnut jobâ€ who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked, & then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself, bad on TV. Abused staff,...
@realDonaldTrump	Great cohesion inside the Republican Party, the best I have ever seen. Despite all of the Fake News, my Poll Numbers are great. New internal polls show them to be the strongest weâ€™ve had so far! Think what theyâ€™d be if I got fair media coverage!
@realDonaldTrump	....The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!
@realDonaldTrump	Denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksenâ€™s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland, I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time....

@realDonaldTrump	....that when this Administrationâ€™s alternative is no longer available, California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative, which is much better for consumers!
@realDonaldTrump	Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesnâ€™t work as well, because execs donâ€™t want to fight California regulators. Car companies should know....
@realDonaldTrump	The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan, the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors, are â€œrolling overâ€ at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good, and cost $3,000 more to consumers. Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œTax cuts, deregulation, and an Administration dedicated to growing business have allowed the U.S. economy to flourish.

@realDonaldTrump	For the record, Denmark is only at 1.35% of GDP for NATO spending. They are a wealthy country and should be at 2%. We protect Europe and yet, only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are at the 2% mark. The United States is at a much, much higher level than that....

@realDonaldTrump	....WHERE IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE?
@realDonaldTrump	So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money, while the U.S., a far stronger and more important credit, is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History, very tough on exports. No Inflation!.....
@realDonaldTrump	My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!
@realDonaldTrump	.....We are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate, and we should be lower than them. Yesterday, â€œhighest Dollar in U.S.History.â€ No inflation. Wake up Federal Reserve. Such growth potential, almost like never before!
@realDonaldTrump	Doing great with China and other Trade Deals. The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed. Heâ€™s like a golfer who canâ€™t putt, has no touch. Big U.S. growth if he does the right thing, BIG CUT - but donâ€™t count on him! So far he has called it wrong, and only let us down....
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News LameStream Media is doing everything possible the â€œcreateâ€ a U.S. recession, even though the numbers & facts are working totally in the opposite direction. They would be willing to hurt many people, but that doesnâ€™t matter to them. Our Economy is sooo strong, sorry!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe speed bump has been missteps by the Federal Reserve.â€ @cvpayne @foxandfriends  So true!
@realDonaldTrump	Rep Tlaib wants to cut off aid to Israel. This is the new face the of Democrat Party? Read the AOC PLUS 3 statements on their hatred of Jews and Israel. Check out Rep. Omar (the great people of Minnesota wonâ€™t stand for this).

@realDonaldTrump	Just heard that Sean Spicer will be on â€œDancing with the Stars.â€ He will do great. A terrific person who loves our Country dearly!
@realDonaldTrump	The Economy is doing really well. The Federal Reserve can easily make it Record Setting! The question is being asked, why are we paying much more in interest than Germany and certain other countries? Be early (for a change), not late. Let America win big, rather than just win!
@realDonaldTrump	Germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields. Germany competes with the USA. Our Federal Reserve does not allow us to do what we must do. They put us at a disadvantage against our competition. Strong Dollar, No Inflation! They move like quicksand. Fight or go home!

@realDonaldTrump	....your companies HOME and making your products in the USA. I will be responding to Chinaâ€™s Tariffs this afternoon. This is a GREAT opportunity for the United States. Also, I am ordering all carriers, including Fed Ex, Amazon, UPS and the Post Office, to SEARCH FOR & REFUSE,....

@realDonaldTrump	....My only question is, who is our bigger enemy, Jay Powell or Chairman Xi?
@realDonaldTrump	As usual, the Fed did NOTHING! It is incredible that they can â€œspeakâ€ without knowing or asking what I am doing, which will be announced shortly. We have a very strong dollar and a very weak Fed. I will work â€œbrilliantlyâ€ with both, and the U.S. will do great...

@realDonaldTrump	North Carolina Governor Cooper Vetoed a Bill that would have required Sheriffs to cooperate with Ice. This is a terrible decision for the great people of North Carolina. He should reverse his decision and get back to the basics of fighting crime!

@realDonaldTrump	â€œFace It, You Probably Got A Tax Cut!â€ This was a New York Times headline, and it is very true. If Republicans take back the House, and keep the Senate and Presidency, one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income Tax Cut! Democrats only want to raise your taxes!
@realDonaldTrump	....having fun. I was smiling as I looked up and around. The MANY reporters with me were smiling also. They knew the TRUTH...And yet when I saw the reporting, CNN, MSNBC and other Fake News outlets covered it as serious news & me thinking of myself as the Messiah. No more trust!
@realDonaldTrump	When I looked up to the sky and jokingly said â€œI am the chosen one,â€ at a press conference two days ago, referring to taking on Trade with China, little did I realize that the media would claim that I had a â€œMessiah complex.â€ They knew I was kidding, being sarcastic, and just....

@realDonaldTrump	The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders, who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before, happens to be, â€œMr. President, why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?â€
@realDonaldTrump	Big Trade Deal just agreed to with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Will be great for our Farmers, Ranchers and more. Really big Corn purchase!
@realDonaldTrump	So @donnabrazile gives Crooked Hillary the Questions, and now sheâ€™s on @FoxNews!
@realDonaldTrump	Rasmussen at 50%. @MediaBuzzFNC & @FoxNews are only getting worse! Now @donnabrazile & others on Fox. Not what it used to be! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1165071131608571904Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Great working breakfast this morning with Prime Minister @BorisJohnson at the HÃ´tel du Palais in Biarritz, France! #G7Biarritz pic.twitter.com/ISQRFz7kJO
@realDonaldTrump	Such False and Inaccurate reporting thus far on the G-7. The Fake News knows this but they canâ€™t help themselves! Leaving now to have breakfast with Boris J.
@realDonaldTrump	....bad Economic times, the worse the better, anything to make my Election more difficult to win. Well, we are having very good meetings, the Leaders are getting along very well, and our Country, economically, is doing great - the talk of the world!
@realDonaldTrump	Before I arrived in France, the Fake and Disgusting News was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the G-7 are very tense, and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster. Just like they are trying to force a Recession, they are trying to â€œwillâ€ America into..

@realDonaldTrump	Great respect for the fact that President Xi & his Representatives want â€œcalm resolution.â€ So impressed that they are willing to come out & state the facts so accurately.

@realDonaldTrump	The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!

@realDonaldTrump	.@SteveHiltonx â€œThe Democrats statements about Donald Trump are lies. Here are the Facts.â€ I will soon be posting the entire segment. Too much positive news, too many good things, to Tweet. PLEASE BE SURE TO WATCH! Thank you Steve Hilton for being a real pro and not being afraid!
@realDonaldTrump	....Another is a one-time BAD Congressman from Illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide, then failed in radio. The third is a man who couldnâ€™t stand up straight while receiving an award. I should be able to take them!
@realDonaldTrump	Can you believe it? Iâ€™m at 94% approval in the Republican Party, and have Three Stooges running against me. One is â€œMr. Appalachian Trailâ€ who was actually in Argentina for bad reasons....
@realDonaldTrump	Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE, letâ€™s see, what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said, â€œwhy donâ€™t we say he wants to bomb a hurricane, that should do it!â€ The media in our Country is totally out of control!
@realDonaldTrump	They do stories so big on Elizabeth â€œPocahontasâ€ Warrenâ€™s crowd sizes, adding many more people than are actually there, and yet my crowds, which are far bigger, get no coverage at all. Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	It is amazing that I can be at 51% with Zogby when the Fake & Corrupt News is almost 100% against me. Great job Mr. President!
@realDonaldTrump	The G7 in France was so successful, and yet when I came back and read the Corrupt and Fake News, and watched numerous networks, it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the Great G7 event!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to being with Dan Bishop in two weeks, in North Carolina. His opponent believes in Open Borders and Sanctuary Cities, and wonâ€™t protect your Second Amendment!  https://www.donaldjtrump.com/events/sep-noca-2019/Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	The Federal Reserve loves watching our manufacturers struggle with their exports to the benefit of other parts of the world. Has anyone looked at what almost all other countries are doing to take advantage of the good old USA? Our Fed has been calling it wrong for too long!

@realDonaldTrump	Wow! Yet another big storm heading to Puerto Rico. Will it ever end? Congress approved 92 Billion Dollars for Puerto Rico last year, an all time record of its kind for â€œanywhere.â€
@realDonaldTrump	The G-7 was a great success for the USA and all. LameStream Media coverage bore NO relationship to what actually happened in France - FAKE NEWS. It was GREAT!
@realDonaldTrump	No bedbugs at Doral. The Radical Left Democrats, upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7, spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!
@realDonaldTrump	Starting to look good for the highly respected Prime Minister of the Italian Republic, Giuseppe Conte. Represented Italy powerfully at the G-7. Loves his Country greatly & works well with the USA. A very talented man who will hopefully remain Prime Minister!
@realDonaldTrump	I have gotten to know President @jairbolsonaro well in our dealings with Brazil. He is working very hard on the Amazon fires and in all respects doing a great job for the people of Brazil - Not easy. He and his country have the full and complete support of the USA!
@realDonaldTrump	Just returned to Washington from France and the very successful G-7, only to find that the Fake News is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that I wanted to use Nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. This is so ridiculous, never happened!
@realDonaldTrump	A sad day for the Democrats, Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary. Iâ€™m glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!

@realDonaldTrump	Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly), I would give them a Pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS!
@realDonaldTrump	The Wall is going up very fast despite total Obstruction by Democrats in Congress, and elsewhere!  https://www.instagram.com/p/B1t2uUeBXdU/?igshid=b6tjibw3fnwsÂ â€¦ pic.twitter.com/2nFIEFppho
@realDonaldTrump	....And by the way, Iâ€™m the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to Puerto Rico!
@realDonaldTrump	Puerto Rico is one of the most corrupt places on earth. Their political system is broken and their politicians are either Incompetent or Corrupt. Congress approved Billions of Dollars last time, more than anyplace else has ever gotten, and it is sent to Crooked Pols. No good!....
@realDonaldTrump	Our Federal Reserve cannot â€œmentallyâ€ keep up with the competition - other countries. At the G-7 in France, all of the other Leaders were giddy about how low their Interest Costs have gone. Germany is actually â€œgetting paidâ€ to borrow money - ZERO INTEREST PLUS! No Clue Fed!
@realDonaldTrump	....I donâ€™t want to Win for myself, I only want to Win for the people. The New @FoxNews is letting millions of GREAT people down! We have to start looking for a new News Outlet. Fox isnâ€™t working for us anymore!
@realDonaldTrump	....are all in for the Open Border Socialists (or beyond). Fox hires â€œgive Hillary the questionsâ€ @donnabrazile, Juan Williams and low ratings Shep Smith. HOPELESS & CLUELESS! They should go all the way LEFT and I will still find a way to Win - Thatâ€™s what I do, Win. Too Bad!....
@realDonaldTrump	Just watched @FoxNews heavily promoting the Democrats through their DNC Communications Director, spewing out whatever she wanted with zero pushback by anchor, @SandraSmithFox. Terrible considering that Fox couldnâ€™t even land a debate, the Dems give them NOTHING! @CNN & @MSNBC....
@realDonaldTrump	Would be very hard for Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of Britainâ€™s Labour Party, to seek a no-confidence vote against New Prime Minister Boris Johnson, especially in light of the fact that Boris is exactly what the U.K. has been looking for, & will prove to be â€œa great one!â€ Love U.K.
@realDonaldTrump	We are tracking closely tropical storm Dorian as it heads, as usual, to Puerto Rico. FEMA and all others are ready,  and will do a great job. When they do, let them know it, and give them a big Thank You - Not like last time. That includes from the incompetent Mayor of San Juan!
@realDonaldTrump	So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China, from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably - In fact, they got taken to the cleaners. We are doing very well with China. This has never happened to them before!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe infestation of bedbugs at The New York Times officeâ€ @OANN  was perhaps brought in by lightweight journalist Bret Stephens, a Conservative who does anything that his bosses at the paper tell him to do! He is now quitting Twitter after being called a â€œbedbug.â€ Tough guy!
@realDonaldTrump	A made up Radical Left Story about Doral bedbugs, but Bret Stephens is loaded up with them! Been calling me wrong for years, along with the few remaining Never Trumpers - All Losers! https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1166291203022868480Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Perhaps never in the history of our Country has someone been more thoroughly disgraced and excoriated than James Comey in the just released Inspector Generalâ€™s Report. He should be ashamed of himself!
@realDonaldTrump	The Farmers are going to be so happy when they see what we are doing for Ethanol, not even including the E-15, year around, which is already done. It will be a giant package, get ready! At the same time I was able to save the small refineries from certain closing. Great for all!
@realDonaldTrump	The Economy is doing GREAT, with tremendous upside potential! If the Fed would do what they should, we are a Rocket upward!
@realDonaldTrump	The totally inaccurate reporting by Lawrence Oâ€™Donnell, for which he has been forced by NBC to apologize, is NO DIFFERENT than the horrible, corrupt and fraudulent Fake News that I (and many millions of GREAT supporters) have had to put up with for years. So bad for the USA!
@realDonaldTrump	....for the most ridiculous claim of all, that Russia, Russia, Russia, or Russian oligarchs, co-signed loan documents for me, a guarantee. Totally false, as is virtually everything else he, and much of the rest of the LameStream Media, has said about me for years. ALL APOLOGIZE!
@realDonaldTrump	Crazy Lawrence Oâ€™Donnell, who has been calling me wrong from even before I announced my run for the Presidency, even being previously forced by NBC to apologize, which he did while crying, for things he said about me & The Apprentice, was again forced to apologize, this time.....
@realDonaldTrump	Hurricane Dorian looks like it will be hitting Florida late Sunday night. Be prepared and please follow State and Federal instructions, it will be a very big Hurricane, perhaps one of the biggest!
@realDonaldTrump	Puerto Rico is in great shape with Hurricane Dorian taking a largely different route than anticipated. Thank you to FEMA, first responders, and all, for working so hard & being so well prepared. A great result! The bad news, Florida get ready! Storm is building and will be BIG!
@realDonaldTrump	There has never been a time in the history of our Country that the Media was so Fraudulent, Fake, or Corrupt! When the â€œAge of Trumpâ€ is looked back on many years from now, I only hope that a big part of my legacy will be the exposing of massive dishonesty in the Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	The  Amazon Washington Post and @CNN just did a Fake Interview on Pardons for Aids on the Wall, and that I didnâ€™t think the Wall on the Southern Border was that important to stop Illegals wanting to come into our Country. WRONG, vitally important. Will make a BIG impact. So bad!
@realDonaldTrump	....pass the laugh test, and the Inspector General just knocked that down.â€ @ByronYork @LouDobbs
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThey could have charged Comey with theft of government documents, 641 of the Criminal Code, because the IG found these were not his personal documents, these were government documents.â€ @GreggJarrett  â€œComeyâ€™s claim that these were just his own personal recollections would not..
@realDonaldTrump	Just arrived at Camp David!
@realDonaldTrump	The Great State of North Carolina has EARLY VOTING for a very important Congressional (Ninth) race. Please vote early (now), or on Election Day, September 10th, for Dan Bishop, a great guy. His opponent wants Open Borders, Sanctuary Cities & is weak on Crime, Military & Vets!

@realDonaldTrump	If the Fed would cut, we would have one of the biggest Stock Market increases in a long time. Badly run and weak companies are smartly blaming these small Tariffs instead of themselves for bad management...and who can really blame them for doing that? Excuses!
@realDonaldTrump	....We donâ€™t have a Tariff problem (we are reigning in bad and/or unfair players), we have a Fed problem. They donâ€™t have a clue!
@realDonaldTrump	The Euro is dropping against the Dollar â€œlike crazy,â€ giving them a big export and manufacturing advantage...and the Fed does NOTHING! Our Dollar is now the strongest in history. Sounds good, doesnâ€™t it? Except to those (manufacturers) that make product for sale outside the U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	Bryan Dean Wright, former CIA Officer(Dem): â€œIn 2016 we had a Coup. We have to take Comey and others to task. Makes no sense not to prosecute him. Comey got a book deal. I fear for my Country. He tried to kneecap our duly elected president, and there are no consequences.â€ @fox&Fs
@realDonaldTrump	The fact that James Comey was not prosecuted for the absolutely horrible things he did just shows how fair and reasonable Attorney General Bill Barr is. So many people and experts that I have watched and read would have taken an entirely different course. Comey got Lucky!
@realDonaldTrump	The disastrous IG Report on James Comey shows, in the strongest of terms, how unfairly I, and tens of millions of great people who support me, were treated. Our rights and liberties were illegally stripped away by this dishonest fool. We should be given our stolen time back?

@realDonaldTrump	General Motors, which was once the Giant of Detroit, is now one of the smallest auto manufacturers there. They moved major plants to China, BEFORE I CAME INTO OFFICE. This was done despite the saving help given them by the USA. Now they should start moving back to America again?
@realDonaldTrump	Just briefed by Attorney General Barr about the shootings in Texas. FBI and Law Enforcement is fully engaged. More to follow.
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe vindication belongs to the President for firing James Comey. It was clearly the right thing to do. You donâ€™t want an FBI Director with Jim Comeyâ€™s ethics.â€ Jason Riley, Wall Street Journal

@realDonaldTrump	Being scolded by failed former â€œIntelligenceâ€ officials, like James Clapper, on my condolences to Iran on their failed Rocket launch. Sadly for the United States, guys like him, Comey, and the even dumber John Brennan, donâ€™t have a clue. They really set our Country back,....
@realDonaldTrump	Just watched Congresswoman Debbie Dingell, and many other Democrats, wanting to give up on our very successful Trade battle with China, which has had its worst Economic year in memory (and getting worse). We are taking in $Billions. Will be big for Farmers and ALL!

@realDonaldTrump	While Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement, she is a very good person and I donâ€™t think there would ever be reason to use it. She called me yesterday to apologize, had a bad night. I fully understood and forgave her! I love Tiffany, doing great!

@realDonaldTrump	â€œJames Comey has been rebuked at the highest level, with much more to come. An IG Report doesnâ€™t get any stronger, calling him dangerous, insubordinate.

@realDonaldTrump	Such a phony hurricane report by lightweight reporter @jonkarl of @ABCWorldNews. I suggested yesterday at FEMA that, along with Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina, even Alabama could possibly come into play, which WAS true. They made a big deal about this...
@realDonaldTrump	....The good news is that we are winning. Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!
@realDonaldTrump	The LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY! They write whatever they want, seldom have sources (even though they say they do), never do â€œfact checkingâ€ anymore, and are only looking for the â€œkill.â€ They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake, they are Corrupt..

@realDonaldTrump	Just watched AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka on @FoxNews and thought to myself how different he is on TV than he is when he is with me at the White House. Likes what we are doing until the cameras go on. We got robbed on Trade and everything else while his Dems just sat back....

@realDonaldTrump	Germany, and so many other countries, have negative interest rates, â€œthey get paid for loaning money,â€ and our Federal Reserve fails to act! Remember, these are also our weak currency competitors!
@realDonaldTrump	For all of the â€œgeniusesâ€ out there, many who have been in other administrations and â€œtaken to the cleanersâ€ by China, that want me to get together with the EU and others to go after China Trade practices remember, the EU & all treat us VERY unfairly on Trade also. Will change!

@realDonaldTrump	I agree with @jimcramer, the Fed should lower rates. They were WAY too early to raise, and Way too late to cut - and big dose quantitative tightening didnâ€™t exactly help either. Where did I find this guy Jerome? Oh well, you canâ€™t win them all!
@realDonaldTrump	DACA will be going before the Supreme Court. It is a document that even President Obama didnâ€™t feel he had the legal right to sign - he signed it anyway! Rest assured that if the SC does what all say it must, based on the law, a bipartisan deal will be made to the benefit of all!
@realDonaldTrump	....President Obama never had the legal right to sign DACA, and he indicated so at the time of signing. But In any event, how can he have the right to sign and I donâ€™t have the right to â€œunsigned.â€ Totally illegal document which would actually give the President new powers.
@realDonaldTrump	....have the discretion to end the program that President Obama began in his discretion. That program was unlawful to begin with. I think itâ€™s very unlikely that the SCOTUS is going to issue an order reinstating what it believes is an unlawful program. DACA Is unlawful.â€ .....
@realDonaldTrump	The Immigration Law Instituteâ€™s Christopher Hajec says, â€œThe Supreme Court has to look st whether DACA is lawful. What they are looking at now is whether Trumpâ€™s recision of DACA is lawful. Must consider lawfulness of DACA itself. Looks very odd that President Trump doesnâ€™t.....

@realDonaldTrump	The Failing New York Times stated, in an article written by Obama flunky Peter Baker (who lovingly wrote Obama book),â€Even after the President forecast the storm to include Alabama.â€ THIS IS NOT TRUE. I said, VERY EARLY ON, that it MAY EVEN hit Alabama. A BIG DIFFERENCE.....

@realDonaldTrump	The Trump Administration has achieved more in the first 2 1/2 years of its existence than perhaps any administration in the history of our Country. We get ZERO media credit for what we have done, and are doing, but the people know, and thatâ€™s all that is important!
@realDonaldTrump	I had nothing to do with the decision of our great @VP Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg, Ireland. Mikeâ€™s family has lived in Doonbeg for many years, and he thought that during his very busy European visit, he would stop and see his family!
@realDonaldTrump	I know nothing about an Air Force plane landing at an airport (which I do not own and have nothing to do with) near Turnberry Resort (which I do own) in Scotland, and filling up with fuel, with the crew staying overnight at Turnberry (they have good taste!). NOTHING TO DO WITH ME
@realDonaldTrump	..that this Administration has done. They donâ€™t talk about the great economy, the big tax and regulation cuts, the rebuilding of the Military, â€œChoiceâ€ at our VA, our Vets, Judges and Supreme Court Justices, the Border Wall going up, lowest crime numbers, 2nd A, and so much more!
@realDonaldTrump	As bad as @CNN is, Comcast MSNBC is worse. Their ratings are also way down because they have lost all credibility. I believe their stories about me are not 93% negative, but actually 100% negative. They are incapable of saying anything positive, despite all of the great things...
@realDonaldTrump	...But most importantly, @CNN is bad for the USA. Their International Division spews bad information & Fake News all over the globe. This is why foreign leaders are always asking me, â€œWhy does the Media hate the U.S. sooo much?â€ It is a fraudulent shame, & all comes from the top!
@realDonaldTrump	Great news that an activist investor is now involved with AT&T. As the owner of VERY LOW RATINGS @CNN, perhaps they will now put a stop to all of the Fake News emanating from its non-credible â€œanchors.â€ Also, I hear that, because of its bad ratings, it is losing a fortune.....
@realDonaldTrump	94% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years. It forces great people, and real leaders, to leave after serving. The Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems, it is a better way to go. Fewer people, in the end, will leave!
@realDonaldTrump	...but then he ran for Congress and won, only to lose his re-elect after I Tweeted my endorsement, on Election Day, for his opponent. But now take heart, he is back, and running for President of the United States. The Three Stooges, all badly failed candidates, will give it a go!

@realDonaldTrump	One of the greatest and most powerful weapons used by the Fake and Corrupt News Media is the phony Polling Information they put out. Many of these polls are fixed, or worked in such a way that a certain candidate will look good or bad. Internal polling looks great, the best ever!
@realDonaldTrump	ABC/Washington Post Poll was the worst and most inaccurate poll of any taken prior to the 2016 Election. When my lawyers protested, they took a 12 point down and brought it to almost even by Election Day. It was a Fake Poll by two very bad and dangerous media outlets. Sad!

@realDonaldTrump	In a hypothetical poll, done by one of the worst pollsters of them all, the Amazon Washington Post/ABC, which predicted I would lose to Crooked Hillary by 15 points (how did that work out?), Sleepy Joe, Pocahontas and virtually all others would beat me in the General Election....
@realDonaldTrump	....The USA should always be paying the the lowest rate. No Inflation!

@realDonaldTrump	European Central Bank, acting quickly, Cuts Rates 10 Basis Points. They are trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the Euro against the VERY strong Dollar, hurting U.S. exports.... And the Fed sits, and sits, and sits. They get paid to borrow money, while we are paying interest!

@realDonaldTrump	The two big Congressional wins in North Carolina on Tuesday, Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, have reverberated all over the World. They showed a lot of people how strong the Republican Party is, and how well it is doing. 2020 is a big, and very important, Election. We will WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	....VERY stupidly negotiated Trade Deals, and Illegal Immigration, are a tremendous cost and burden to our Country. They are BOTH coming along very well and someday, in the not too distant future, America will see a very positive change. Remember, America First!
@realDonaldTrump	Illegal Immigration costs the USA over 300 Billion Dollars a year. There is no reason for this, and things are being set in motion to have this number come WAY DOWN. Democrats could end Loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier, and faster. But it will all happen anyway!....
@realDonaldTrump	....IG Report, which showed him to be a Disgraced & Dirty Cop. Republicans have unified like never before. You donâ€™t impeach Presidents for doing a good (great!) job. No Obstruction, No Collusion, only treasonous crimes committed by the other side, and led by the Democrats. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump	....Became Number 1 in World & Independent in Energy. Will soon have record number of Judges, 2 SC Justices. Done more than any President in first 2 1/2 years despite phony & fraudulent Witch Hunt illegally led against him. WIN on Mueller Report, Mueller Testimony & James Comey..
@realDonaldTrump	How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt Military & Choice for Vets...

@realDonaldTrump	Who the hell is Joy-Ann Reid? Never met her, she knows ZERO about me, has NO talent, and truly doesnâ€™t have the â€œitâ€ factor needed for success in showbiz. Had a bad reputation, and now works for the Comcast/NBC losers making up phony stories about me. Low Ratings. Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œA Very Stable Genius!â€ Thank you.
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, â€œNo Conditions.â€ That is an incorrect statement (as usual!).

@realDonaldTrump	PLENTY OF OIL!
@realDonaldTrump	Saudi Arabia oil supply was attacked. There is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the Kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!
@realDonaldTrump	....sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied. I have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in Texas and various other States.
@realDonaldTrump	Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount....
@realDonaldTrump	....Then, on top of it all, Kathleen Parker, of all people, wrote â€œIn Case You Were Wondering, Trump Won The Debate.â€ True, but what is going on at the @washingtonpost? NOT Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	Canâ€™t believe the @washingtonpost wrote a positive front page story, â€œUnity Issue Has Parties Pointing To Trump. GOP Goes All In, While Democrats Clash Over Ideology & Tactics. Mr. President, We Are With You The Entire Way. REPUBLICANS Have....Coalesced Around Trump.â€.....
@realDonaldTrump	I am fighting the Fake (Corrupt) News, the Deep State, the Democrats, and the few remaining Republicans In Name Only (RINOS, who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation), with the help of some truly great Republicans, and others. We are Winning big (150th Federal Judge this week)!
@realDonaldTrump	Canâ€™t let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?), false allegations, and lies. This is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaugh
@realDonaldTrump	Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Canâ€™t let that happen!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @foxandfriends and @RepMarkMeadows. Great interview!
@realDonaldTrump	Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!

@realDonaldTrump	â€œHow many stories are wrong? Almost all of the stories the New York Times has done are inaccurate and wrong.â€ @greggutfeld  The New York Times should close its doors and throw away the keys. The women mentioned in the Kavanaugh story said she didnâ€™t even remember the event.

@realDonaldTrump	....for the privilege of being your President - and doing the best job that has been done in many decades. I am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening, or filling up a gas tank at an airport I do not own. These Radical Left Democrats are CRAZY! Obama Netflix?
@realDonaldTrump	They failed on the Mueller Report, they failed on Robert Muellerâ€™s testimony, they failed on everything else, so now the Democrats are trying to build a case that I enrich myself by being President. Good idea, except I will, and have always expected to, lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS..
@realDonaldTrump	â€œDemocrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.â€ Governor John Sununu @FoxNews @BillHemmer The big questions are, will they â€œmove the goalpostsâ€ and, is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? I hope NOT on both counts, but Iâ€™ll be able to figure it out!
@realDonaldTrump	Remember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their â€œairspaceâ€ when, in fact, it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. Weâ€™ll see?
@realDonaldTrump	Just Out: â€œKavanaugh accuser doesnâ€™t recall incident.â€ @foxandfriends  DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œWhatâ€™s happening to Justice Kavanaugh is a disgrace. This guy is not a good man, he is a great man. He has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him, a disgrace!â€ Dan Bongino @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.â€ @foxandfriends  The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems.
@realDonaldTrump	...The United States, because of the Federal Reserve, is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries. They canâ€™t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell & the Fed donâ€™t have a clue. And now, on top of it all, the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop, Stimulus!
@realDonaldTrump	Producer prices in China shrank most in 3 years due to Chinaâ€™s big devaluation of their currency, coupled with monetary stimulus. Federal Reserve not watching? Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER! Really bad for exports. No Inflation...Highest Interest Rates...
@realDonaldTrump	Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We donâ€™t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!
@realDonaldTrump	.....â€™These Conservative Judicial appointments will impact our nation for years to come,â€™ said Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who leads the Judiciary Committee and who has been speeding through Trump nominees.â€ The entire Court System is changing at a record pace!
@realDonaldTrump	The @nytimes. â€œThis week, the Senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th Federal Judge of Mr. Trumpâ€™s Administration to a lifetime appointment, far outstripping Barack Obamaâ€™s pace and fulfilling pledges by Mr. Trump and Mr. Oâ€™Connell to remake the Federal Judiciary....
@realDonaldTrump	....work that way. I have a better idea. Look at the Obama Book Deal, or the ridiculous Netflix deal. Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress, the â€œCongressional Slush Fund,â€ and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!
@realDonaldTrump	House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION, ZERO OBSTRUCTION. So they say, OK, lets look at everything else, and all of the deals that â€œTrumpâ€ has done over his lifetime. But it doesnâ€™t....

@realDonaldTrump	There has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt!

@realDonaldTrump	The Whistleblowerâ€™s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called â€œWhistleblowerâ€ knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong, just like Liddleâ€™ Adam Schiff..
@realDonaldTrump	....The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President, who told the Fake News, at the United Nations, that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY, SHAPE, OR FORM, should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!

@realDonaldTrump	Somebody please wake up Mitt Romney and tell him that my conversation with the Ukrainian President was a congenial and very appropriate one, and my statement on China pertained to corruption, not politics. If Mitt worked this hard on Obama, he could have won. Sadly, he choked!
@realDonaldTrump	The so-called Whistleblowerâ€™s account of my perfect phone call is â€œway off,â€ not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise, they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!

@realDonaldTrump	The Do Nothing Democrats are Con Artists, only looking to hurt the Republican Party and President. Their total focus is 2020, nothing more, and nothing less. The good news is that WE WILL WIN!!!!
@realDonaldTrump	....IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! We went to war under a false & now disproven premise, WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE! Now we are slowly & carefully bringing our great soldiers & military home. Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE.....
@realDonaldTrump	Fighting between various groups that has been going on for hundreds of years. USA should never have been in Middle East. Moved our 50 soldiers out. Turkey MUST take over captured ISIS fighters that Europe refused to have returned. The stupid endless wars, for us, are ending! https://twitter.com/TwitterMoments/status/1181053382850514947Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	.....The Whistleblowerâ€™s lawyer is a big Democrat. The Whistleblower has ties to one of my DEMOCRAT OPPONENTS. Why does the ICIG allow this scam to continue?
@realDonaldTrump	The Whistleblowerâ€™s facts have been so incorrect about my â€œno pressureâ€ conversation with the Ukrainian President, and now the conflict of interest and involvement with a Democrat Candidate, that he or she should be exposed and questioned properly. This is no Whistleblower.....
@realDonaldTrump	A Total Scam by the Do Nothing Democrats. For the good of the Country, this Wirch Hunt should end now! https://twitter.com/JesseBWatters/status/1181682375425712128Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Wow, Just Breaking: â€œThe (big deal) Whistleblower had a â€˜PROFESSIONAL TIEâ€™ to 2020 Democratic Candidate.â€ Washington Examiner, @ByronYork  In other words, was working with someone who was potentially running against me. Why wasnâ€™t this reported by the ICIG? A Witch Hunt Scam!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œBob Mueller was pursuing the FBI Director job when he met with President Trump in 2017, Administration officials say.â€ @FoxNews  Bret Baier and Jake Gibson @seanhannity This is true even though Mueller denied it!

@realDonaldTrump	Gasoline Prices in the State of California are MUCH HIGHER than anywhere else in the Nation ($2.50 vs. $4.50). I guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just arenâ€™t doing the trick! Donâ€™t worry California, relief is on the way. The State doesnâ€™t get it!
@realDonaldTrump	....If there is a Runoff in Louisiana, you will have a great new Republican Governor who will Cut your Taxes and Car Insurance, and do a fabulous job for you and your family. Vote Republican, the Party of Honest Abe Lincoln!
@realDonaldTrump	Big Rally in Louisiana on Friday night. Must force a runoff with a Liberal Democrat Governor, John Bel Edwards, who has let your Taxes and Car Insurance get too high, and will never protect your 2nd Amendment. Vote for one of our two great Republicans on Saturday, force a runoff!

@realDonaldTrump	....We have one of three choices: Send in thousands of troops and win Militarily, hit Turkey very hard Financially and with Sanctions, or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds!
@realDonaldTrump	We defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate and no longer have any troops in the area under attack by Turkey, in Syria. We did our job perfectly! Now Turkey is attacking the Kurds, who have been fighting each other for 200 years....
@realDonaldTrump	Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal, but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.
@realDonaldTrump	Why isnâ€™t the IG investigating his so-called Whistleblower? All bad info!
@realDonaldTrump	The President of the Ukraine just stated again, in the strongest of language, that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong. He used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat Scam, but it wonâ€™t, because the Dems & Media are FIXED!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to @OANN One America News for your fair coverage and brilliant reporting. It is appreciated by many people trying so hard to find a new, consistent and powerful VOICE! See you tonight at the Big Rally in Minneapolis.
@realDonaldTrump	....the area and start a new war all over again. Turkey is a member of NATO. Others say STAY OUT, let the Kurds fight their own battles (even with our financial help). I say hit Turkey very hard financially & with sanctions if they donâ€™t play by the rules! I am watching closely.
@realDonaldTrump	Turkey has been planning to attack the Kurds for a long time. They have been fighting forever. We have no soldiers or Military anywhere near the attack area. I am trying to end the ENDLESS WARS. Talking to both sides. Some want us to send tens of thousands of soldiers to....

@realDonaldTrump	From the day I announced I was running for President, I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is, they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano, who wanted to be a Supreme....
@realDonaldTrump	â€œUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters Thursday his controversial July call with President Trump involved no bribe, blackmail or quid pro quo, as impeachment-minded Democrats claim.â€ This should immediately end the talk of impeachment! https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ukraine-president-says-no-blackmail-in-phone-call-with-trumpÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	In case the Kurds or Turkey lose control, the United States has already taken the 2 ISIS militants tied to beheadings in Syria, known as the Beetles, out of that country and into a secure location controlled by the U.S. They are the worst of the worst!
@realDonaldTrump	Impeached for what, having created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country, building our strongest ever Military, Cutting Taxes too much? https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1181969511697788928Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	One of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that, for various reasons, we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process. When the deal is fully negotiated, I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be in Louisiana tonight (Love it!) to get Republicans to vote for either of our two great Republican Candidates and force a run off with John Bel Edwards, who has done a really poor job of tax cutting, car insurance cost (worst in USA), & is suspect on your 2nd Amendment!
@realDonaldTrump	Good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past, more like the Old Days. I will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!

@realDonaldTrump	Louisiana, get out and vote REPUBLICAN before going to the big game today. A runoff will be a tremendous win for your Great State - lower taxes and car insurance, and better protection of your 2nd Amendment! Fantastic being with you last night!
@realDonaldTrump	....Other aspects of the deal are also great - technology, financial services, 16-20 Billion in Boeing Planes etc., but WOW, the Farmers really hit pay dirt! @ChuckGrassley @joniernst @debfisher @BenSasse  Thank you to all Republicans in Congress for your invaluable help!
@realDonaldTrump	The deal I just made with China is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!

@realDonaldTrump	.@marklevinshow on @FoxNews is doing a big show tonight on the Democratâ€™s Impeachment Scam. 10:00 P.M. No guests, just Mark. He is angry (like so many others!). At 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews, Steve Hilton is looking into the Crooked Bidens. Whereâ€™s Hunter?
@realDonaldTrump	.....BY THE WAY, DONâ€™T CALL ME AGAIN, Iâ€™LL CALL YOU WHEN YOUâ€™VE DONE WHAT Iâ€™VE ASKED.â€™â€ A reminder, that wasnâ€™t just stupid, it was FALSE.â€ @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @FoxNews  I never said this. Schiff made it up and read it to Congress & the American People. End Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œCongressman Adam Schiff, who when seeing the REAL Ukraine phone call Transcript decided heâ€™d better make up one of his own. â€˜Iâ€™m going to say this only SEVEN times, so you better listen good.

@realDonaldTrump	....I agreed not to increase Tariffs from 25% to 30% on October 15th. They will remain at 25%. The relationship with China is very good. We will finish out the large Phase One part of the deal, then head directly into Phase Two. The Phase One Deal can be finalized & signed soon!
@realDonaldTrump	My deal with China is that they will IMMEDIATELY start buying very large quantities of our Agricultural Product, not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks. THEY HAVE ALREADY STARTED! Likewise financial services and other deal aspects, start preparing....
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are going to lose a lot of House Seats because of their Fraudulent use of Impeachment. Schiff fabricated phone call, a crime. Democrat Senate Seats will also be put at risk, even some that were supposedly safe. Look at Louisiana last night, North Carolina last week!

@realDonaldTrump	Whereâ€™s Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.
@realDonaldTrump	Dealing with @LindseyGrahamSC and many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey. Treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!
@realDonaldTrump	.....The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!
@realDonaldTrump	Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey......
@realDonaldTrump	Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?
@realDonaldTrump	The Media is not talking about the big Republican victory last night in Louisiana where a sitting Democrat Governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%. Big upset! Now @EddieRispone, who will be a great Governor, will win!
@realDonaldTrump	A despicable human being! https://twitter.com/DanScavino/status/1183230623563034624Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	The same people that got us into the Middle East Quicksand, 8 Trillion Dollars and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side), are now fighting to keep us there. Donâ€™t listen to people that havenâ€™t got a clue. They have proven to be inept!
@realDonaldTrump	The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN, @EddieRispone. Thank you Louisiana! 66% down to 47% after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.

@realDonaldTrump	....I would much rather focus on our Southern Border which abuts and is part of the United States of America. And by the way, numbers are way down and the WALL is being built!
@realDonaldTrump	Some people want the United States to protect the 7,000 mile away Border of Syria, presided over by Bashar al-Assad, our enemy. At the same time, Syria and whoever they chose to help, wants naturally to protect the Kurds....
@realDonaldTrump	....and Assad to protect the land of our enemy? Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!
@realDonaldTrump	After defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land. I said to my Generals, why should we be fighting for Syria....
@realDonaldTrump	....Don't the Europeans have a lot of responsibility?â€ @KatiePavlich Thank you Katie, I offered ISIS prisoners to the European countries from where they came, and was rejected on numerous occasions. They probably figured that the U.S. would bear the tremendous cost as always!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œTo his credit the Europeans didn't step up to deal with this ISIS problem â€“ itâ€™s a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today. Now, Angela Merkel of Germany is finally stepping up and telling Turkey to back off....

@realDonaldTrump	Brian Kilmeade over at @foxandfriends got it all wrong. We are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for 200 years. Europe had a chance to get their ISIS prisoners, but didnâ€™t want the cost. â€œLet the USA pay,â€ they said...

@realDonaldTrump	Adam Schiff now doesnâ€™t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify. NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close. Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblowerâ€™s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA..
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe Democrats are trashing this President, & in the process, trashing the U.S. Constitution.

@realDonaldTrump	Hunter Biden was really bad on @GMA. Now Sleepy Joe has real problems! Reminds me of Crooked Hillary and her 33,000 deleted Emails, not recoverable!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings. If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News. Let the facts come out from the charade of people, most of whom I do not know, they are interviewing for 9 hours each, not selective leaks.
@realDonaldTrump	â€œProject Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zuckerâ€™s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNNâ€™s BIAS!â€ @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good, or even great, lawsuit?
@realDonaldTrump	A big scandal at @ABC News. They got caught using really gruesome FAKE footage of the Turks bombing in Syria. A real disgrace. Tomorrow they will ask softball questions to Sleepy Joe Bidenâ€™s son, Hunter, like why did Ukraine & China pay you millions when you knew nothing? Payoff?
@realDonaldTrump	Shifty Schiff now seems to think they donâ€™t need the Whistleblower, who started the whole Scam. The reason is that the Whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the Transcript. Also, the second Whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!

@realDonaldTrump	Senator Rand Paul just wrote a great book, â€œThe Case Against Socialismâ€ which is now out. Highly recommended â€“ as America was founded on LIBERTY & INDEPENDENCE â€“ not government coercion, domination & control. We were born free, and will stay free, as long as I am your President!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers, no questions, no transparency! The good news is that the Radical Left Dems have No Case. It is all based on their Fraud and Fabrication!
@realDonaldTrump	Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!
@realDonaldTrump	95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Just won two Congressional Seats in North Carolina,  & a Governors runoff in Louisiana, which Republicans should now win! Because of Impeachment Fraud, we will easily take back the House, add in the Senate, & again win Pres!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œWhat is happening to President Trump with Impeachment is a Constitutional Travesty.â€ @GrahamLedger  The likes of which we have never seen before. It is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!
@realDonaldTrump	You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States. Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!

@realDonaldTrump	.... It also brings Shiftyâ€™s fraudulent MADE UP CALL, which he read to the United States Congress pretending it to be the words of President Trump, which they were not! Nancy Pelosi is involved in this fraud in that she confirmed his fraudulent words on @GMA, and much more!
@realDonaldTrump	Shifty Adam Schiff wants to rest his entire case on a Whistleblower who he now says canâ€™t testify, & the reason he canâ€™t testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the Presidential telephone call is a fraud & totally different from the actual transcribed call...

@realDonaldTrump	This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary, but somewhat unconventional, path. People have been trying to make this â€œDealâ€ for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!
@realDonaldTrump	This deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some â€œtoughâ€ love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all!

@realDonaldTrump	I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars, and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position, until I took it. Democrats always liked Walls, until I built them. Do you see whatâ€™s happening here?
@realDonaldTrump	â€œAbout 500,000 human beings were killed in Syria while Barack Obama was president & leading for a â€œpolitical settlementâ€ to that civil war. Media has been more outraged in the last 72 hours over our Syria policy than they were at any point during 7 years of slaughter.â€ BuckSexton
@realDonaldTrump	Hope all House Republicans, and honest House Democrats, will vote to CENSURE Rep. Adam Schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating (making up) a totally phony conversation with the Ukraine President and U.S. President, me. Most have never seen such a thing!

@realDonaldTrump	I want to thank Secretary of Energy Rick Perry for the outstanding job he has done. He will be leaving at the end of the year to pursue other interests. Rick was a great Governor of Texas and a great Secretary of Energy....

@realDonaldTrump	.....this thinking years ago. Instead, it was always held together with very weak bandaids, & in an artificial manner. There is good will on both sides & a really good chance for success. The U.S. has secured the Oil, & the ISIS Fighters are double secured by Kurds & Turkey....
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to President @RTErdogan of Turkey. He told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated. He very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work. Likewise, the Kurds want it, and the ultimate solution, to happen. Too bad there wasnâ€™t.....

@realDonaldTrump	Pelosi and Impeachment - There have already been 3 Votes, and theyâ€™ve all failed miserably. Hereâ€™s why there may not be a fourth - 137 Democrats voted against on the last vote.â€ @JasonChaffetz @seanhannity  Many of those voting in favor will be beaten in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman Michael McCaul, â€œSchiffâ€™s inquiry defies Democracy.â€ @FoxNews @seanhannity
@realDonaldTrump	â€œBecause the House has already voted against the Impeachment Proceeding, the current inquiry is totally invalid. The current sham of a so-called investigation is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab. It needs to end.â€  @JasonChaffetz @seanhannity  Corrupt Adam Schiff
@realDonaldTrump	Corrupt Congressman Adam Schiff is angry that Ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent Witch Hunt, are turning out to be good for me - some really good! Heâ€™s got all meetings locked down, no transparency, only his illegal leaks. A very dishonest sleazebag!
@realDonaldTrump	So interesting that, when I announced Trump National Doral in Miami would be used for the hosting of the G-7, and then rescinded due to Do Nothing Democrat/Fake News Anger, very few in Media mentioned that NO PROFITS would be taken, or would be given FREE, if legally permissible!
@realDonaldTrump	....fiction to Congress and the American People?  I demand his deposition. He is a fraud, just like the Russia Hoax was, and the Ukraine Hoax is now. When do the Do Nothing Democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our Country, & when do the Republicans finally fight back?
@realDonaldTrump	....because their so-called story didnâ€™t come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call. Was it a Corrupt Adam Schiff con? Why didnâ€™t the IG see this? When do we depose Shifty Schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this..
@realDonaldTrump	This Scam going on right now by the Democrats against the Republican Party, and me, was all about a perfect phone call I had with the Ukrainian President. Heâ€™s already stated, NO PRESSURE! Where is the Whistleblower, or the 2nd Whistleblower, or the â€œinformant?â€ All gone.....
@realDonaldTrump	Pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9, including Corrupt Adam Schiff, to Jordan to check out Syria. She should find out why Obama drew The Red Line In the Sand, & then did NOTHING, losing Syria & all respect. I did something, 58 missiles. One million died under Obamaâ€™s mistake!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with Kurds. U.S. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. We have secured the Oil.â€ Mark Esper, Secretary of Defense. Ending endless wars!

@realDonaldTrump	.....its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!
@realDonaldTrump	I thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders. It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have...
@realDonaldTrump	Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Doral in Miami would have been the best place to hold the G-7, and free, but too much heat from the Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats & their Partner, the Fake News Media! Iâ€™m surprised that they allow me to give up my $400,000 Plus Presidential Salary! Weâ€™ll find someplace else!

@realDonaldTrump	â€œI thought a very revealing poll was done by The New York Times.

@realDonaldTrump	The Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it. Even Shifty Schiff got caught cheating when he made up what I said on the call!
@realDonaldTrump	....We should all work together to clean up these hazardous waste and homeless sites before the whole city rots away. Very bad and dangerous conditions, also severely impacting the Pacific Ocean and water supply. Pelosi must work on this mess and turn her District around!
@realDonaldTrump	I canâ€™t believe that Nancy Pelosiâ€™s District in San Francisco is in such horrible shape that the City itself is in violation of many sanitary & environmental orders, causing it to owe the Federal Government billions of dollars - and all she works on is Impeachment.....
@realDonaldTrump	â€œNot a single American citizen has been charged with anything related to Russian Collusion, not one person.â€ @TuckerCarlson  It was all an illegal Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Had a beautiful dinner last night at Camp David in celebration of the 10th Wedding Anniversary of Ivanka and Jared. Attended by a small number of family and friends, it could not have been nicer. Camp David is a special place. Cost of the event will be totally paid for by me!
@realDonaldTrump	...Thank you @foxandfriends! Hopefully this is just the beginning of a massive story of injustice and treason. You will never learn this from the corrupt LameStream Media who get Pulitzer Prizes for reporting the story totally wrong. The ones who report it right get only RESPECT!
@realDonaldTrump	..the President when Flynn had been cleared of everything long before that. The DOJ is withholding a lot of evidence & information, as are Clapper & Brennan & all of the people who participated in the complete setup of Michael Flynn.â€(Terrible!) Sidney Powell. This is a disgrace!
@realDonaldTrump	....They exonerated him completely of being an agent of Russia (Recently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard & Jill Stein with the same thing-SICK), and yet Mr. Comey still runs to the White House on February 14 and conjures up the Obstruction of Justice narrative against.....

@realDonaldTrump	Can you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff, the biggest leaker in D.C., and a corrupt politician, is upset that we didnâ€™t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!? Wouldnâ€™t be surprised if the Do Nothing Democrats Impeach me over that! DRAIN THE SWAMP!!

@realDonaldTrump	The S&P just hit an ALL TIME HIGH. This is a big win for jobs, 401-Kâ€™s, and, frankly, EVERYONE! Our Country is doing great. Even killed long sought ISIS murderer, Al-Baghdadi. We are stronger than ever before, with GREAT upward potential. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party. Our Polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish, led by a corrupt politician, Adam Schiff!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œOver in Europe and Japan they have NEGATIVE RATES. They get paid to borrow money. Donâ€™t we have to follow our competitors?â€ @Varneyco  Yes we do. The Fed doesnâ€™t have a clue! We have unlimited potential, only held back by the Federal Reserve. But we are winning anyway!

@realDonaldTrump	95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a record. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	Supposedly, according to the Corrupt Media, the Ukraine call â€œconcernedâ€ todayâ€™s Never Trumper witness. Was he on the same call that I was? Canâ€™t be possible! Please ask him to read the Transcript of the call. Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT! I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many?
@realDonaldTrump	The Do Nothing Democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the Best Economy Ever, the monumental weekend raid, Tax Cuts, the Rebuilding of our Military, etc. The Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace. Read the transcript!
@realDonaldTrump	Whereâ€™s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript, everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!

@realDonaldTrump	â€œThis is a big win for America, and also for President Trump.â€ @nypost
@realDonaldTrump	The only crimes in the Impeachment Hoax were committed by Shifty Adam Schiff, when he totally made up my phone conversation with the Ukrainian President and read it to Congress, together with numerous others on Shiftyâ€™s side. Schiff should be Impeached, and worse!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThere is no underlying crime in that transcript.â€ @IngrahamAngle  100% correct, and the Whistleblower disappeared after I released the transcript of the call. Where is the Whistleblower? That is why this is now called the Impeachment Hoax! The Do Nothing Dems are Doing Nothing!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œAmericans know by now that the Impeachment inquiry is just another hoax and silent coup to remove the President from office.â€ J.J. Crovatto  Donâ€™t worry J.J., Schiff is a leaker & corrupt politician who made up what I said on the call in order to hurt the Republican Party & me!
@realDonaldTrump	"The Democrats have been on this path for 3 years.

@realDonaldTrump	Yesterdayâ€™s Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call. There were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	A Federal Judge is allowing the Nick Sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting Washington Post (which is no longer available at the White House!). He could now have a good chance of winning. Go Nick!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œIt does appear it has to do with Nancy Pelosi retaining her Speakership in the next Congress. She would like that so sheâ€™s going to put it to a vote because thatâ€™s what her political left really wants.â€ @SteveDoocy @foxandfriends  A disgraceful use of Impeachment. Will backfire!
@realDonaldTrump	The Greatest Economy in American History!
@realDonaldTrump	.....the call with the Ukrainian President was a totally appropriate one. As he said, â€œNo Pressure.â€ This Impeachment nonsense is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt Hoax, which has been going on since before I even got elected. Rupublicans, go with Substance and close it out!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans are very unified and energized in our fight on the Impeachment Hoax with the Do Nothing Democrats, and now  are starting to go after the Substance even more than the very infair Process because just a casual reading of the Transcript leads EVERYBODY to see that.....

@realDonaldTrump	False stories are being reported that a few Republican Senators are saying that President Trump may have done a quid pro quo, but it doesnâ€™t matter, there is nothing wrong with that, it is not an impeachable event. Perhaps so, but read the transcript, there is no quid pro quo!
@realDonaldTrump	....should give their own transcripts of the interviews to contrast with Schiffâ€™s manipulated propaganda. House Republicans must have nothing to do with Shiftyâ€™s rendition of those interviews. He is a proven liar, leaker & freak who is really the one who should be impeached!
@realDonaldTrump	If Shifty Adam Schiff, who is a corrupt politician who fraudulently made up what I said on the â€œcall,â€ is allowed to release transcripts of the Never Trumpers & others that are & were interviewed, he will change the words that were said to suit the Dems purposes. Republicans...

@realDonaldTrump	The Radical Left Dems and LameStream Media are just trying to make it hard for Republicans and me to win in 2020. The new Impeachment Hoax is already turning against them!
@realDonaldTrump	The Amazon Washington Post and three lowlife reporters, Matt Zapotosky, Josh Dawsey, and Carol Leonnig, wrote another Fake News story, without any sources (pure fiction), about Bill Barr & myself. We both deny this story, which they knew before they wrote it. A garbage newspaper!

@realDonaldTrump	It was just explained to me that for next weeks Fake Hearing (trial) in the House, as they interview Never Trumpers and others, I get NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS. It is a Pelosi, Schiff, Scam against the Republican Party and me. This Witch Hunt should not be allowed to proceed!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œWhat did Hunter Biden do for the money?â€ @SenJohnKennedy  A very good question. He and Sleepy Joe must testify!
@realDonaldTrump	Based on the information released last night about the Fake Whistleblowers attorney, the Impeachment Hoax should be ended IMMEDIATELY! There is no case, except against the other side!
@realDonaldTrump	Read the Transcript!
@realDonaldTrump	The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference. Never happened, and there were no sources!
@realDonaldTrump	Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine. The story was a Fake Washington Post con job with an â€œanonymousâ€ source that doesnâ€™t exist. Just read the Transcript. The Justice Department already ruled that the call was good. We donâ€™t have freedom of the press!

@realDonaldTrump	I recommend that Nervous Nancy Pelosi (who backed up Schiffâ€™s lie), Shifty Adam Schiff, Sleepy Joe Biden, the Whistleblower (who miraculously disappeared after I released the transcript of the call), the 2nd Whistleblower (who also disappeared), & the I.G., be part of the list!

@realDonaldTrump	The call to the Ukrainian President was PERFECT. Read the Transcript! There was NOTHING said that was in any way wrong. Republicans, donâ€™t be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect, but is not impeachable. No, it is much stronger than that. NOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThereâ€™s nothing there! Iâ€™m trying to let the House know that theyâ€™re dividing America for no good reason. Weâ€™ve got a lot of things we should be doing, like lowering drug costs & getting a trade deal with Mexico and Canada.â€ @LindseyGrahamSC  The Do Nothing Dems have gone crazy!

@realDonaldTrump	Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts. We havenâ€™t even seen the documents and are restricted from (get this) having a lawyer. Republicans should put out their own transcripts! Schiff must testify as to why he MADE UP a statement from me, and read it to all!

@realDonaldTrump	Where is the Fake Whistleblower?
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans & others must remember, the Ukrainian President and Foreign Minister both said that there was no pressure placed on them whatsoever. Also, they didnâ€™t even know the money wasnâ€™t paid, and got the money with no conditions. But why isnâ€™t Germany, France (Europe) paying?
@realDonaldTrump	The Crazed, Do Nothing Democrats are turning Impeachment into a routine partisan weapon. That is very bad for our Country, and not what the Founders had in mind!!!!
@realDonaldTrump	Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, & see the just released ststement from Ukraine. Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I donâ€™t know & mostly never even heard of, & work out a better presidential attack!

@realDonaldTrump	Just finished a very good & cordial meeting at the White House with Jay Powell of the Federal Reserve. Everything was discussed including interest rates, negative interest, low inflation, easing, Dollar strength & its effect on manufacturing, trade with China, E.U. & others, etc.
@realDonaldTrump	....that I testify about the phony Impeachment Witch Hunt. She also said I could do it in writing. Even though I did nothing wrong, and donâ€™t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea & will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Crazy, Do Nothing (whereâ€™s USMCA, infrastructure, lower drug pricing & much more?) Speaker of the House, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, who is petrified by her Radical Left knowing she will soon be gone (they & Fake News Media are her BOSS), suggested on Sundayâ€™s DEFACE THE NATION....
@realDonaldTrump	Never has the Republican Party been so united as it is now. 95% A.R. This is a great fraud being played out against the American people by the Fake News Media & their partner, the Do Nothing Democrats. The rules are rigged by Pelosi & Schiff, but we are winning, and we will win!

@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat, but to go after President Trump, only. The Failing New York Times thinks that is O.K., because their hatred & bias is so great they canâ€™t even see straight. Itâ€™s not O.K.!
@realDonaldTrump	Just landed in the United Kingdom, heading to London for NATO meetings tomorrow. Prior to landing I read the Republicans Report on the Impeachment Hoax. Great job! Radical Left has NO CASE. Read the Transcripts. Shouldnâ€™t even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?
@realDonaldTrump	The Fed should lower rates (there is almost no inflation) and loosen, making us competitive with other nations, and manufacturing will SOAR! Dollar is very strong relative to others.
@realDonaldTrump	Manufacturers are being held back by the strong Dollar, which is being propped up by the ridiculous policies of the Federal Reserve - Which has called interest rates and quantitative tightening wrong from the first days of Jay Powell!

@realDonaldTrump	In the 3 decades before my election, NATO spending declined by two-thirds, and only 3 other NATO members were meeting their financial obligations. Since I took office, the number of NATO allies fulfilling their obligations more than DOUBLED, and NATO spending increased by $130B!

@realDonaldTrump	.....The Penalty Tariffs set for December 15th will not be charged because of the fact that we made the deal. We will begin negotiations on the Phase Two Deal immediately, rather than waiting until after the 2020 Election. This is an amazing deal for all. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	We have agreed to a very large Phase One Deal with China. They have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of Agricultural Product, Energy, and Manufactured Goods, plus much more. The 25% Tariffs will remain as is, with 7 1/2% put on much of the remainder....
@realDonaldTrump	The Wall Street Journal story on the China Deal is completely wrong, especially their statement on Tariffs. Fake News. They should find a better leaker!
@realDonaldTrump	Record Stock Market & Jobs!
@realDonaldTrump	How do you get Impeached when you have done NOTHING wrong (a perfect call), have created the best economy in the history of our Country, rebuilt our Military, fixed the V.A. (Choice!), cut Taxes & Regs, protected your 2nd A, created Jobs, Jobs, Jobs, and soooo much more? Crazy!

@realDonaldTrump	Poll numbers have gone through the roof in favor of No Impeachment, especially with Swing States and Independents in Swing States. People have figured out that the Democrats have no case, it is a total Hoax. Even Pelosi admitted yesterday that she began this scam 2 1/2 years ago!

@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for â€œtwo and a half years.â€ In other words, she lied. This was the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats plan all along, long before the Ukraine phone call. Impeachment Hoax!

@realDonaldTrump	So now Comeyâ€™s admitting he was wrong. Wow, but heâ€™s only doing so because he got caught red handed. He was actually caught a long time ago. So what are the consequences for his unlawful conduct. Could it be years in jail? Where are the apologies to me and others, Jim?
@realDonaldTrump	A PERFECT phone call. â€œCan you do us (not me. Us is referring to our Country) a favor.â€ Then go on to talk about â€œCountryâ€ and â€œU.S. Attorney General.â€ The Impeachment Hoax is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which has been going on for 3 years.

@realDonaldTrump	The Democrat Partyâ€™s Witch Hunt and CRAZY EXTREME policies are chasing common sense people out of the Dem Party. Thatâ€™s why Jeff Van Drew (@CongressmanJVD) voted NO on the Impeachment Hoax. Jeff will be joining our growing Republican Party....
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman @ScottRTipton is a great supporter of the #MAGA Agenda! He fights for your #2A rights and the Border Wall. Scott is working hard for Colorado and has my Complete and Total Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Franklin Graham for stating that his father, the late great Billy Graham, voted for me in the 2016 Election. I know how pleased you are with the work we have all done together! https://www.breitbart.com/2020-election/2019/12/20/franklin-graham-slams-christianity-today-my-father-billy-graham-voted-for-donald-trump/Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	I guess the magazine, â€œChristianity Today,â€ is looking for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or those of the socialist/communist bent, to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!
@realDonaldTrump	Had a very good talk with President Xi of China concerning our giant Trade Deal. China has already started large scale purchaes of agricultural product & more. Formal signing being arranged. Also talked about North Korea, where we are working with China, & Hong Kong (progress!).
@realDonaldTrump	I will be signing our 738 Billion Dollar Defense Spending Bill today. It will include 12 weeks  Paid Parental Leave, gives our troops a raise, importantly creates the SPACE FORCE, SOUTHERN BORDER WALL FUNDING, repeals â€œCadillac Taxâ€ on Health Plans, raises smoking age to 21! BIG!
@realDonaldTrump	....have a Radical Left nonbeliever, who wants to take your religion & your guns, than Donald Trump as your President. No President has done more for the Evangelical community, and itâ€™s not even close. Youâ€™ll not get anything from those Dems on stage. I wonâ€™t be reading ET again!
@realDonaldTrump	A far left magazine, or very â€œprogressive,â€ as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasnâ€™t been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather.....

@realDonaldTrump	â€œWhatâ€™s been revealed is a Country in better shape than itâ€™s been in decades. Working men and women in the Country are the beneficiaries of a President whoâ€™s doing exactly what he said he was going to do, that is to restore prosperity for all Americans.â€ @LouDobbs  Thank you Lou!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThis is political malpractice. This is a horrible judgement call on the part of the Speaker. You put your members in Trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot. Itâ€™s only going to extend it out further. This looks like the joke that it actually is.â€ Ben Domenech
@realDonaldTrump	The reason the Democrats donâ€™t want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they donâ€™t want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath, nor do they want the Whistleblower, the missing second Whistleblower, the informer, the Bidens, to testify!
@realDonaldTrump	The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax. The Republicans have never been so united!  The Demâ€™s case is so bad that they donâ€™t even want to go to trial!
@realDonaldTrump	So after the Democrats gave me no Due Process in the House, no lawyers, no witnesses, no nothing, they now want to tell the Senate how to run their trial. Actually, they have zero proof of anything, they will never even show up. They want out. I want an immediate trial!
@realDonaldTrump	Last night I was so proud to have signed the largest Defense Bill ever. The very vital Space Force was created. New planes, ships, missiles, rockets and equipment of every kind, and all made right here in the USA. Additionally, we got Border Wall (being built) funding. Nice!

@realDonaldTrump	Proud of @JimInhofeâ€™s tenacious Oklahoma spirit that got the NDAA done. Maybe the best yet because it takes care of troops & establishes SPACE FORCE, which is 1st new branch since 1947 (Air Force). Another huge win for Jimâ€™s legacy.

@realDonaldTrump	My Administration pushed to include a big expansion to Veteran telehealth in the spending bill so that the brave men and women who served our Country get the care they need. #RuralProsperity
@realDonaldTrump	Honored to finally put an end to the â€œWidowâ€™s Taxâ€ and ensure that our surviving military spouses receive their full benefits. The spouses and families of our fallen heroes have suffered enough and WE must do everything in our power to ease the burden.
@realDonaldTrump	We will always provide for our Veterans and their mental health. I pushed Congress to provide $10 Billion for Vet mental health, suicide prevention outreach, and funding for my PREVENTS Initiative to end Vet suicide. Congress responded. A big win for our Vets!
@realDonaldTrump	A total Witch Hunt! https://twitter.com/AP/status/1207609959241932800Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Crazy Nancy wants to dictate terms on the Impeachment Hoax to the Republican Majority Senate, but striped away all Due Process, no lawyers or witnesses, on the Democrat Majority House. The Dems just wish it would all end. Their case is dead, their poll numbers are horrendous!

@realDonaldTrump	Wouldnâ€™t it be reasonable to assume that Republicans in the Senate should handle the Impeachment Hoax in the exact same manner as Democrats in the House handled their recent partisan scam? Why would it be different for Republicans than it was for the Radical Left Democrats?
@realDonaldTrump	....What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial. None! She has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision. This Witch Hunt must end NOW with a trial in the Senate, or let her default & lose. No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi, who has already lost the House & Speakership once, & is about to lose it again, is doing everything she can to delay the zero Republican vote Articles of Impeachment. She is trying to take over the Senate, & Cryinâ€™ Chuck is trying to take over the trial. No way!....
@realDonaldTrump	Pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress, and now she is crying for fairness in the Senate, and breaking all rules while doing so. She lost Congress once, she will do it again!
@realDonaldTrump	187 new Federal Judges have been confirmed under the Trump Administration, including two great new United States Supreme Court Justices. We are shattering every record! Read all about this in â€œThe Long Game,â€ a great new book by @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell. Amazing story!
@realDonaldTrump	The ONLY reason we were able to get our great USMCA Trade Deal approved was because the Do Nothing Democrats wanted to show that they could approve  something productive in light of the fact that all they even think about is impeachment. She knows nothing about the USMCA Deal!

@realDonaldTrump	â€œNancy Pelosi has no leverage over the Senate. Mitch McConnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the House, and she has no standing in the Senate.â€ Brad Blakeman. Crazy Nancy should clean up her filthy dirty District & help the homeless there. A primary for N?
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosiâ€™s District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless & crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast - she has lost total control and, along with her equally incompetent governor, Gavin Newsom, it is a very sad sight!
@realDonaldTrump	Brad Blakeman â€œI happen to believe as a lawyer that the charges are defective, they donâ€™t meet the Constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors, so I would like to see a Motion to Dismiss. At least 51 Republican Senators would agree with that-there should be no trial.â€
@realDonaldTrump	The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats said they wanted to RUSH everything through to the Senate because â€œPresident Trump is a threat to National Securityâ€ (they are vicious, will say anything!), but now they donâ€™t want to go fast anymore, they want to go very slowly. Liars!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œLook, the House is supposed to do all of this work on witnesses and documents BEFORE they send the articles over to the Senate, not to call in new witnesses, go through new documents - that work is supposed to be done in the House.â€ @KatiePavlich @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	...& overwhelming,â€ but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also, very unfair with no Due Process, proper representation, or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans werenâ€™t allowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!
@realDonaldTrump	Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi, just because she has a slight majority in the House, be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes, there was no crime, the call with Ukraine was perfect, with â€œno pressure.â€ She said it must be â€œbipartisan...

@realDonaldTrump	Remember when Pelosi was screaming that President Trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly. They didnâ€™t get one Republican House vote, and lost 3 Dems. They produced no case so now she doesnâ€™t want to go to the Senate. Sheâ€™s all lies. Most overrated person I know!

@realDonaldTrump	The United States has paid Iraq Billions of Dollars a year, for many years. That is on top of all else we have done for them. The people of Iraq donâ€™t want to be dominated & controlled by Iran, but ultimately, that is their choice. Over the last 15 years, Iran has gained more....
@realDonaldTrump	....of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!
@realDonaldTrump	General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more...but got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number....

@realDonaldTrump	Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently....
@realDonaldTrump	As hard as I work, & as successful as our Country has become with our Economy, our Military & everything else, it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time & money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax. I should be able to devote all of my time to the REAL USA!

@realDonaldTrump	These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!

@realDonaldTrump	Congress & the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote, & we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!
@realDonaldTrump	The Impeachment Hoax, just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election, must end quickly. Read the Transcripts, see the Ukrainian Presidentâ€™s strong statement, NO PRESSURE - get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!
@realDonaldTrump	â€œThe reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic.â€ @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo  The great Scam continues. To be spending time on this political Hoax at this moment in our history, when I am so busy, is sad!

@realDonaldTrump	The government of Iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground on the ongoing protests by the Iranian people. There can not be another massacre of peaceful protesters, nor an internet shutdown. The world is watching.
@realDonaldTrump	To the brave, long-suffering people of Iran: I've stood with you since the beginning of my Presidency, and my Administration will continue to stand with you. We are following your protests closely, and are inspired by your courage.

@realDonaldTrump	Now the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, are asking @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell to do the job that they were unable to do. They proved NOTHING but my total innocence in the House, despite the most unfair & biased hearings in the history of Congress. Now they demand fairness!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!
@realDonaldTrump	New polling shows that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is going nowhere. A vast majority want the Do Nothing Democrats to move on to other things now!
@realDonaldTrump	Where have the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani, one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? He was also looking to do big future damage! Dems are â€œunhinged.â€
@realDonaldTrump	â€œFBI Director apologizes for FISA Errors (of which there were far to many to be a coincidence!).â€ @FoxNews Chris, what about all of the lives that were ruined because of the so-called â€œerrors?â€ Are these â€œdirty copsâ€ going to pay a big price for the fraud they committed?
@realDonaldTrump	National Security Adviser suggested today that sanctions & protests have Iran â€œchoked offâ€, will force them to negotiate. Actually, I couldnâ€™t care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but, no nuclear weapons and â€œdonâ€™t kill your protesters.â€
@realDonaldTrump	Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, â€œno pressureâ€  Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party. So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!
@realDonaldTrump	You canâ€™t make this up!  David Kris, a highly controversial former DOJ official, was just appointed by the FISA Court to oversee reforms to the FBIâ€™s surveillance procedures. Zero credibility. THE SWAMP! @DevinNunes @MariaBartiromo @FoxNews

@realDonaldTrump	House Republicans investigating origins of the Ukraine Whistleblower complaint. ICIG Michael Atkinson facing serious questions. â€œThe Democrats know the ICIG is a major problem-didnâ€™t release his testimony. Looks so much like everything else weâ€™ve seen, from the Russia Hoax, to...
@realDonaldTrump	Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did NOTHING wrong? Read the Transcripts! A totally partisan Hoax, never happened before. House Republicans voted 195-0, with three Dems voting with the Republicans. Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!
@realDonaldTrump	Why did Nervous Nancy allow corrupt politician Shifty Schiff to lie before Congress? He must be a Witness, and so should she!
@realDonaldTrump	Great idea. This phony Impeachment Hoax should not even be allowed to proceed. Did NOTHING wrong. Just a partisan vote. Zero Republicans. Never happened before! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1216212972391096320Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	â€œPelosi has made a mockery of Impeachment. Her Articles are so weak. But more importantly, she thought she could extort the Senate. She couldnâ€™t.â€ @GreggJarrett @foxandfriends The Do Nothing Democrats are really run by the Radical Left. Too bad!

@realDonaldTrump	....and then helped to fund them...And zero progress was made on curbing those activities, until Trump droned Soleimani...Plainly, Trump is not a warmonger. Heâ€™s a deal maker & his record is that of someone who uses our military might as a deterrent, unleashes it with....
@realDonaldTrump	Michael Goodwin, New York Post: â€œTrumpâ€™s peace through strength philosophy is what America needs. His (John Kerry) claim bears no relation to reality. The Agreement didnâ€™t create opportunities for America & other signatories to confront Iranâ€™s malign activities. It overlooked....
@realDonaldTrump	John Kerry got caught essentially admitting that funds given ridiculously to Iran were used to fund attacks on the USA. Only a complete fool would have given that 150 Billion Dollars Plus to Iran. They then went on a Middle East Rampage! @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth
@realDonaldTrump	George @GStephanopoulos, ask Crazy Nancy why she allowed Adam â€œShiftyâ€ Schiff to totally make up my conversation with the Ukrainian President & read his false words to Congress and the world, as though I said it? He got caught! Ask why hearing was most unfair & biased in history?
@realDonaldTrump	To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!

@realDonaldTrump	â€œWe demand fairnessâ€ shouts Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats, yet the Dems in the House wouldnâ€™t let us have 1 witness, no lawyers or even ask questions. It was the most unfair witch-hunt in the history of Congress!
@realDonaldTrump	Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker, who was in zero polling territory, just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was â€œimminentâ€ or not, & was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES., but it doesnâ€™t really matter because of his horrible past!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on, or in any way denigrate, our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it, and they walked around it instead. Big progress!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy, only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do, whether itâ€™s the economy, military, or anything else, will be scorned by the Rafical Left, Do Nothing Democrats!
@realDonaldTrump	Bernie Sanderâ€™s volunteers are trashing Elizabeth â€œPocahontusâ€ Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Mini Mike B is also trying, but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?
@realDonaldTrump	....and, if Republicans win in court and take back the House of Represenatives, your healthcare, that I have now brought to the best place in many years, will become the best ever, by far. I will always protect your Pre-Existing Conditions, the Dems will not!
@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising. I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual  Mandate.....
@realDonaldTrump	Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer just said, â€œThe American people want a fair trial in the Senate.â€ True, but why didnâ€™t Nervous Nancy and Corrupt politician Adam â€œShiftyâ€ Schiff give us a fair trial in the House. It was the most lopsided & unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!
@realDonaldTrump	We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers  and other violent criminal elements. They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

@realDonaldTrump	The Democrat House would not give us lawyers, or not one witness, but now demand that the Republican Senate produce the witnesses that the House never sought, or even asked for? They had their chance, but pretended to rush. Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!

@realDonaldTrump	Why didnâ€™t John Bolton complain about this â€œnonsenseâ€ a long time ago, when he was very publicly terminated. He said, not that it matters, NOTHING!
@realDonaldTrump	No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats, no matter how much information is given, like the quickly produced Transcripts, it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB!
@realDonaldTrump	If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died to secureâ€”then we must devote everything we have toward victory in 2020.

@realDonaldTrump	My @SuperBowl Interview at 3:30 P.M. on @foxnetworks. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. This is sometimes done, but really not fair!
@realDonaldTrump	Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldnâ€™t do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact, Bloomberg isnâ€™t covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! Itâ€™s all the Fake News Media, and thatâ€™s why nobody believes in them any more.
@realDonaldTrump	The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, donâ€™t want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, & that includes the House & Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far!

@realDonaldTrump	Crazy Nancy Pelosiâ€™s Impeachment Hoax has lifted Republican Congressional Polls (she lost the House once before!), and my Polls, WAY UP, which was expected, but it has had a great effect on Republican Senate races, including North Carolina, Kentucky, Colorado and Arizona. Thanks!

@realDonaldTrump	Canâ€™t say I mind the fact that the great people of West Virginia are furious at their puppet Democrat Senator, Joe Manchin. They will never forget his phony vote on the Impeachment Hoax. All he had to do is read the Transcripts, sadly, which he wouldnâ€™t understand anyway.....

@realDonaldTrump	Hope the Fake News, which never discusses it, is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They wonâ€™t!
@realDonaldTrump	Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax, AOC will primary Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer, and win, and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House, AGAIN! My poll numbers great.
@realDonaldTrump	95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a Record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). Corrupt Democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the Impeachment Hoax. Thank you Nancy!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be in Manchester, New Hampshire, tonight for a big Rally. Want to shake up the Dems a little bit - they have a really boring deal going on. Still waiting for the Iowa results, votes were fried. Big crowds in Manchester!

@realDonaldTrump	Ending surprise medical billing moving ahead in Congress! Thanks to Ways & Means and Education/Labor Committees for your work on Bills to protect patients and end medical bill ripoffs! Work with Energy & Commerce, HELP committees to send BIPARTISAN bill to my desk!
@realDonaldTrump	....If my hands were tied, Iran would have a field day. Sends a very bad signal. The Democrats are only doing this as an attempt to embarrass the Republican Party. Donâ€™t let it happen!
@realDonaldTrump	It is very important for our Countryâ€™s SECURITY that the United States Senate not vote for the Iran War Powers Resolution. We are doing very well with Iran and this is not the time to show weakness. Americans overwhelmingly support our attack on terrorist Soleimani....
@realDonaldTrump	.@dagenmcdowell, â€œEvery Democrat is running to raise taxes. She (Pocahontas) lied about her ethnicity, that was her problem.â€ @MariaBartiromo  So true Dagen!
@realDonaldTrump	Two months in jail for a Swamp Creature, yet 9 years recommended for Roger Stone (who was not even working for the Trump Campaign). Gee, that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp! @foxandfriends @TuckerCarlson
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News @CNN and MSDNC have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in New Hampshire (and in Iowa). Thatâ€™s why they are poorly rated Fake News! I will win both states in November.
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is looking hard for the Big Democrat Story, but there is nothing too fabulous. Wouldnâ€™t a big story be that I got more New Hampshire Primary Votes than any incumbent president, in either party, in the history of that Great State? Not an insignificant fact!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you Brad! https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1227431887838289922Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Bootedgeedge (Buttigieg) is doing pretty well tonight. Giving Crazy Bernie a run for his money. Very interesting!
@realDonaldTrump	A very bad night for Mini Mike!
@realDonaldTrump	A lot of Democrat dropouts tonight, very low political I.Q. https://twitter.com/@realDonaldTrump/status/1226595698793230348Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Who are the four prosecutors (Mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal, the Mueller Scam, and shouldnâ€™t ever even have started? 13 Angry Democrats?
@realDonaldTrump	Impeachment King Steyer (how did that work out?) spent 200 Million Dollars and got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa, and only 3% of the Vote in New Hampshire. Could it be that something is just plain missing? Not easy to do what I did, is it?
@realDonaldTrump	Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is having a really bad night. I think she is sending signals that she wants out. Calling for unity is her way of getting there, going home, and having a â€œnice cold beerâ€ with her husband!
@realDonaldTrump	Whatever happened to Hillary campaign manager Podestaâ€™s BROTHER? Wasnâ€™t he caught, forced to leave his firm, with BIG BAD things to happen? Why did nothing ever happen to him, only to the â€œotherâ€ side?
@realDonaldTrump	...And a swamp creature with â€œpullâ€ was just sentenced to two months in jail for a similar thing that they want Stone to serve 9 years for. A phony Mueller Witch Hunt disgrace. Caught! https://twitter.com/CBS_Herridge/status/1227286163939000320Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton? Just asking! https://twitter.com/katiephang/status/1227286936701718530Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	All starting to unravel with the ridiculous 9 year sentence recommendation! https://twitter.com/CBS_Herridge/status/1227286163939000320Â â€¦
