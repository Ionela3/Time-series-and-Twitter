@realdonaldtrump there is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country. this was a big part of my campaign. study the world!
@realdonaldtrump protesters and the tears of senator schumer. secretary kelly said that all is going well with very few problems. make america safe again!
@realdonaldtrump only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning. big problems at airports were caused by delta computer outage,.....
@realdonaldtrump when will the democrats give us our attorney general and rest of cabinet! they should be ashamed of themselves! no wonder d.c. does not work!
@realdonaldtrump nancy pelosi and fake tears chuck schumer held a rally at the steps of the supreme court and microphone did not work (a mess)-just like demonstrative party!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats are delaying my cabinet picks for purely political reasons. they have nothing going but to obstruct. now have an obama a.g.
@realdonaldtrump everybody is arguing whether or not it is a ban. call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!
@realdonaldtrump hope you like my nomination of judge neil gorsuch for the united states supreme court. he is a good and brilliant man, respected by all.

@realdonaldtrump iran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the u.s. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the iran deal: $150 billion
@realdonaldtrump iran has been formally put on notice for firing a ballistic missile.should have been thankful for the terrible deal the u.s. made with them!
@realdonaldtrump attending chief ryan owens' dignified transfer yesterday with my daughter ivanka was my great honor. to a great and brave man - thank you!

@realdonaldtrump if u.c. berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view - no federal funds?
@realdonaldtrump do you believe it? the obama administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from australia. why? i will study this dumb deal!
@realdonaldtrump iran is rapidly taking over more and more of iraq even after the u.s. has squandered three trillion dollars there. obvious long ago!
@realdonaldtrump we must keep "evil" out of our country!
@realdonaldtrump a new radical islamic terrorist has just attacked in louvre museum in paris. tourists were locked down. france on edge again. get smart u.s.

@realdonaldtrump yes, arnold schwarzenegger did a really bad job as governor of california and even worse on the apprentice...but at least he tried hard!
@realdonaldtrump why are not the lawyers looking at and using the federal court decision in boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
@realdonaldtrump because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. a terrible decision
@realdonaldtrump what is our country coming to when a judge can halt a homeland security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into u.s.?
@realdonaldtrump make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump after being forced to apologize for its bad and inaccurate coverage of me after winning the election, the fake news @nytimes is still lost!
@realdonaldtrump the opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!
@realdonaldtrump interesting that certain middle-eastern countries agree with the ban. they know if certain people are allowed in it is death & destruction!
@realdonaldtrump when a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot , come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble!
@realdonaldtrump countries charge u.s. companies taxes or tariffs while the u.s. charges them nothing or little.we should charge them same as they charge us!
@realdonaldtrump enjoy the #superbowl and then we continue: make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump i have instructed homeland security to check people coming into our country very carefully. the courts are making the job very difficult!
@realdonaldtrump just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. if something happens blame him and court system. people pouring in. bad!
@realdonaldtrump the judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. bad people are very happy!

@realdonaldtrump south korea is finding, as i have told them, that their talk of appeasement with north korea will not work, they only understand one thing!
@realdonaldtrump ..north korea is a rogue nation which has become a great threat and embarrassment to china, which is trying to help but with little success.
@realdonaldtrump north korea has conducted a major nuclear test. their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the united states.....

@realdonaldtrump republicans must start the tax reform/tax cut legislation asap. do not wait until the end of september. needed now more than ever. hurry!
@realdonaldtrump ...never allow the republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 dems control - will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. it is a republic death wish!
@realdonaldtrump republicans, sorry, but i have been hearing about repeal & replace for 7 years, did not happen! even worse, the senate filibuster rule will....
@realdonaldtrump our incredible u.s. coast guard saved more than 15,000 lives last week with harvey. irma could be even tougher. we love our coast guard!

@realdonaldtrump when will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. there always playing politics - bad for our country. i want to solve north korea, syria, ukraine, terrorism, and russia can greatly help!

@realdonaldtrump shoplifting is a very big deal in china, as it should be (5-10 years in jail), but not to father lavar. should have gotten his son out during my next trip to china instead. china told them why they were released. very ungrateful!

@realdonaldtrump ...lavar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during thanksgiving with your son in china, but no nba contract to support you. but remember lavar, shoplifting is not a little thing. itâ€™s a really big deal, especially in china. ungrateful fool!
@realdonaldtrump it wasnâ€™t the white house, it wasnâ€™t the state department, it wasnâ€™t father lavarâ€™s so-called people on the ground in china that got his son out of a long term prison sentence - it was me. too bad! lavar is just a poor manâ€™s version of don king, but without the hair. just think..
@realdonaldtrump obamacare premiums are going up, up, up, just as i have been predicting for two years. obamacare is owned by the democrats, and it is a disaster. but do not worry. even though the dems want to obstruct, we will repeal & replace right after tax cuts!

@realdonaldtrump report: â€śanti-trump fbi agent led clinton email probeâ€ť now it all starts to make sense!
@realdonaldtrump people who lost money when the stock market went down 350 points based on the false and dishonest reporting of brian ross of @abc news (he has been suspended), should consider hiring a lawyer and suing abc for the damages this bad reporting has caused - many millions of dollars!
@realdonaldtrump after years of comey, with the phony and dishonest clinton investigation (and more), running the fbi, its reputation is in tatters - worst in history! but fear not, we will bring it back to greatness.
@realdonaldtrump tainted (no, very dishonest?) fbi â€śagentâ€™s role in clinton probe under review.â€ť led clinton email probe. @foxandfriends clinton money going to wife of another fbi agent in charge.
@realdonaldtrump such a total miscarriage of justice in san francisco! https://twitter.com/dbongino/status/936415283224465410â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump i never asked comey to stop investigating flynn. just more fake news covering another comey lie!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to @abc news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia, russia, russia witch hunt. more networks and â€śpapersâ€ť should do the same with their fake news!
@realdonaldtrump many people in our country are asking what the â€śjusticeâ€ť department is going to do about the fact that totally crooked hillary, after receiving a subpoena from the united states congress, deleted and â€śacid washedâ€ť 33,000 emails? no justice!
@realdonaldtrump so general flynn lies to the fbi and his life is destroyed, while crooked hillary clinton, on that now famous fbi holiday â€śinterrogationâ€ť with no swearing in and no recording, lies many times...and nothing happens to her? rigged system, or just a double standard?

@realdonaldtrump democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive tax cuts is why we need republican roy moore to win in alabama. we need his vote on stopping crime, illegal immigration, border wall, military, pro life, v.a., judges second amendment and more. no to jones, a pelosi/schumer puppet!

@realdonaldtrump fake news cnn made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. they were caught red handed, just like lonely brian ross at abc news (who should be immediately fired for his â€śmistakeâ€ť). watch to see if @cnn fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence?

@realdonaldtrump thank you omarosa for your service! i wish you continued success.
@realdonaldtrump if last nightâ€™s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up great republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the house and senate.
@realdonaldtrump wow, more than 90% of fake news media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. hence my use of social media, the only way to get the truth out. much of mainstream meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends
@realdonaldtrump the reason i originally endorsed luther strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that i said roy moore will not be able to win the general election. i was right! roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to doug jones on a hard fought victory. the write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win. the people of alabama are great, and the republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. it never ends!

@realdonaldtrump do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. the russian collusion hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the dems. public gets it!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats want to shut down the government over amnesty for all and border security. the biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding military, at a time we need it more than ever. we need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now! no more dangerous lottery.
@realdonaldtrump we must have security at our very dangerous southern border, and we must have a great wall to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!

@realdonaldtrump a government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the dems care very little about!
@realdonaldtrump chip should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 day, or short term, extension!
@realdonaldtrump we need the wall for the safety and security of our country. we need the wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. if there is no wall, there is no deal!
@realdonaldtrump will be going to pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to rick saccone, running for congress in a special election (march 13). rick is a great guy. we need more republicans to continue our already successful agenda!
@realdonaldtrump ....the wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the u.s. the $20 billion dollar wall is â€śpeanutsâ€ť compared to what mexico makes from the u.s. nafta is a bad joke!
@realdonaldtrump the wall is the wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day i conceived of it. parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water.....

@realdonaldtrump unprecedented success for our country, in so many ways, since the election. record stock market, strong on military, crime, borders, & isis, judicial strength & numbers, lowest unemployment for women & all, massive tax cuts, end of individual mandate - and so much more. big 2018!
@realdonaldtrump beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all women to march. get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. lowest female unemployment in 18 years!
@realdonaldtrump democrats are holding our military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. canâ€™t let that happen!
@realdonaldtrump #america first!
@realdonaldtrump for those asking, the republicans only have 51 votes in the senate, and they need 60. that is why we need to win more republicans in 2018 election! we can then be even tougher on crime (and border), and even better to our military & veterans!
@realdonaldtrump this is the one year anniversary of my presidency and the democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #democratshutdown
@realdonaldtrump democrats are far more concerned with illegal immigrants than they are with our great military or safety at our dangerous southern border. they could have easily made a deal but decided to play shutdown politics instead. #weneedmorerepublicansin18 in order to power through mess!
@realdonaldtrump not looking good for our great military or safety & security on the very dangerous southern border. dems want a shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the tax cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.
@realdonaldtrump great to see how hard republicans are fighting for our military and safety at the border. the dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. if stalemate continues, republicans should go to 51% (nuclear option) and vote on real, long term budget, no c.r.â€™s!

@realdonaldtrump ...lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for future illegal immigrants. voting for this amendment would be a vote against law enforcement, and a vote for open borders. if dems are actually serious about daca, they should support the grassley bill!
@realdonaldtrump the schumer-rounds-collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @dhsgov says it would be â€śthe end of immigration enforcement in america.â€ť it creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesnâ€™t build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa...
@realdonaldtrump in times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. these bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need. http://45.wh.gov/parklandflâ pic.twitter.com/ootxmcsexb
@realdonaldtrump while the republicans and democrats in congress are working hard to come up with a solution to daca, they should be strongly considering a system of merit based immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the usa!
@realdonaldtrump so many signs that the florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!
@realdonaldtrump russia started their anti-us campaign in 2014, long before i announced that i would run for president. the results of the election were not impacted. the trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
@realdonaldtrump cannot believe how badly daca recipients have been treated by the democrats...totally abandoned! republicans are still working hard.
@realdonaldtrump i will be leaving for florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. am also working with congress on many fronts.
@realdonaldtrump just like they donâ€™t want to solve the daca problem, why didnâ€™t the democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the house & senate during the obama administration. because they didnâ€™t want to, and now they just talk!
@realdonaldtrump "â€śi have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goal.â€ť rob goldman vice president of facebook ads https://twitter.com/robjective/status/964680122950234112â â€¦"
@realdonaldtrump funny how the fake news media doesnâ€™t want to say that the russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for president. maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didnâ€™t know!
@realdonaldtrump deputy a.g. rod rosenstein stated at the news conference: â€śthere is no allegation in the indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.
@realdonaldtrump â€ścharges deal don a big win,â€ť written by michael goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that â€śthe russians had no impact on the election results.â€ť there was no collusion with the trump campaign. â€śshe lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate. case closed.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump melania and i met such incredible people last night in broward county, florida. will never forget them, or the evening!
@realdonaldtrump our entire nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims & their families in parkland, fl. to teachers, law enforcement, first responders & medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: we thank you for your courage! https://instagram.com/p/bfso1z6gpab/â pic.twitter.com/ti791denty
@realdonaldtrump my great friends from nascar are having their big race today, the daytona 500. brian france and the france family are special people. enjoy the race!
@realdonaldtrump thank you to kenstarr, former independent counsel, whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse, russian meddling etcetera. really great interview with @mariabartiromo
@realdonaldtrump great pollster john mclaughlin now has the gop up in the generic congressional ballot. big gain over last 4 weeks. i guess people are loving the big tax cuts given them by the republicans, the cuts the dems want to take away. we need more republicans!
@realdonaldtrump if it was the goal of russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the u.s. then, with all of the committee hearings, investigations and party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. they are laughing their asses off in moscow. get smart america!
@realdonaldtrump now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats, lead by their fearless leader, crooked hillary clinton, lost the 2016 election. but wasnâ€™t i a great candidate?
@realdonaldtrump i never said russia did not meddle in the election, i said â€śit may be russia, or china or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.â€ť the russian â€śhoaxâ€ť was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never did!
@realdonaldtrump finally, liddleâ€™ adam schiff, the leakinâ€™ monster of no control, is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the 2016 election. he is finally right about something. obama was president, knew of the threat, and did nothing. thank you adam!
@realdonaldtrump never gotten over the fact that obama was able to send $1.7 billion dollars in cash to iran and nobody in congress, the fbi or justice called for an investigation!
@realdonaldtrump general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h, the dnc and the dems. remember the dirty dossier, uranium, speeches, emails and the podesta company!
@realdonaldtrump very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter. this is not acceptable. they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion. get back to the basics and make us all proud!
@realdonaldtrump obama was president up to, and beyond, the 2016 election. so why didnâ€™t he do something about russian meddling?
@realdonaldtrump have a great, but very reflective, presidentâ€™s day!
@realdonaldtrump just watched a very insecure oprah winfrey, who at one point i knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 minutes. the questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect. hope oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!
@realdonaldtrump main street is booming thanks to our incredible tax cut and reform law. "this shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses." https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/20/small-business-confidence-hits-record-in-2018-after-tax-reform-win.htmlâ â€¦
@realdonaldtrump ....cameras running. another false accusation. why doesnâ€™t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? one had her home mortgage paid off. only @foxnews so reported...doesnâ€™t fit the mainstream media narrative.
@realdonaldtrump a woman i donâ€™t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the front page of the fake news washington post saying i kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of trump tower 12 years ago. never happened! who would do this in a public space with live security......
@realdonaldtrump i have been much tougher on russia than obama, just look at the facts. total fake news!
@realdonaldtrump hope republicans in the great state of pennsylvania challenge the new â€śpushedâ€ť congressional map, all the way to the supreme court, if necessary. your original was correct! donâ€™t let the dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money!
@realdonaldtrump matt schlapp and cpac are getting ready for another exciting event. big difference from those days when president obama held the white house. youâ€™ve come a long way matt!
@realdonaldtrump republicans are now leading the generic poll, perhaps because of the popular tax cuts which the dems want to take away. actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. also, they want to do nothing on daca, râ€™s want to fix!
@realdonaldtrump ....the president obama quote just before election. thatâ€™s because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didnâ€™t want to â€śrock the boat.â€ť when i easily won the electoral college, the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems.
@realdonaldtrump â€śthere is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig americaâ€™s elections, thereâ€™s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so iâ€™d invite mr. trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.â€ť .....
@realdonaldtrump thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia, including crimea, syria and so much more. we are now starting to win again!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe faith of donald trump,â€ť a book just out by david brody and scott lamb, is a very interesting read. enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump the u.s. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. the unemployment numbers are looking great, and regulations & taxes have been massively cut! jobs, jobs, jobs

@realdonaldtrump yesterday, it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary law enforcement officers and first responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the medal of valor. #americanheroes pic.twitter.com/em0wbbvy5p
@realdonaldtrump question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration, right up to january 20th, why arenâ€™t they the subject of the investigation? why didnâ€™t obama do something about the meddling? why arenâ€™t demonstrative crimes under investigation? ask jeff sessions!
@realdonaldtrump the great billy graham is dead. there was nobody like him! he will be missed by christians and all religions. a very special man.
@realdonaldtrump whether we are republican or democrat, we must now focus on strengthening background checks!

@realdonaldtrump bad ratings @cnn & @msnbc got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall. they probably knew it was fake news but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!

@realdonaldtrump what many people donâ€™t understand, or donâ€™t want to understand, is that wayne, chris and the folks who work so hard at the @nra are great people and great american patriots. they love our country and will do the right thing. make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump i will be strongly pushing comprehensive background checks with an emphasis on mental health. raise age to 21 and end sale of bump stocks! congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - i hope!
@realdonaldtrump ....if a potential â€śsicko shooterâ€ť knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will never attack that school. cowards wonâ€™t go there...problem solved. must be offensive, defense alone wonâ€™t work!
@realdonaldtrump ....history shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. it takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. great deterrent!
@realdonaldtrump ....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. far more assets at much less cost than guards. a â€śgun freeâ€ť school is a magnet for bad people. attacks would end!
@realdonaldtrump i never said â€śgive teachers gunsâ€ť like was stated on fake news @cnn & @nbc. what i said was to look at the possibility of giving â€śconcealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to

@realdonaldtrump big cpac straw poll results: 93% approve of the job president trump is doing (thank you!). 50% say president trump should tweet more or same (funny!). 79% say republicans in congress should do a better job of working with president trump (starting to happen).

@realdonaldtrump looking forward to 3:30 p.m. meeting today at the white house. we have to protect & build our steel and aluminum industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.
@realdonaldtrump spoke to pm @turnbullmalcolm of australia. he is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. working very quickly on a security agreement so we donâ€™t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of australia!

@realdonaldtrump kim jong un talked about denuclearization with the south korean representatives, not just a freeze. also, no missile testing by north korea during this period of time. great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached. meeting being planned!
@realdonaldtrump join me live in moon township, pennsylvania at 7:00pme. great crowd for a #maga rally! https://www.facebook.com/donaldtrump/videos/10160713139290725/â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump the european union, wonderful countries who treat the u.s. very badly on trade, are complaining about the tariffs on steel & aluminum. if they drop their horrific barriers & tariffs on u.s. products going in, we will likewise drop ours. big deficit. if not, we tax cars etcetera. fair!
@realdonaldtrump in the first hours after hearing that north koreaâ€™s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end, the press was startled & amazed.they couldnâ€™t believe it. but by the following morning the news became fake.they said so what, who cares!
@realdonaldtrump north korea has not conducted a missile test since november 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings. i believe they will honor that commitment!
@realdonaldtrump heading to moon township, pennsylvania, to be with a really good person, state representative rick saccone, who is running for congress. big & happy crowd (why not, some of the best economic numbers ever). rick will help me a lot. also, tough on crime & border. loves second a & vets
@realdonaldtrump spoke to prime minister abe of japan, who is very enthusiastic about talks with north korea. also discussing opening up japan to much better trade with the u.s. currently have a massive $100 billion trade deficit. not fair or sustainable. it will all work out!
@realdonaldtrump chinese president xi jinping and i spoke at length about the meeting with kim jong un of north korea. president xi told me he appreciates that the u.s. is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative. china continues to be helpful!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to kristian saucier, a man who has served proudly in the navy, on your newly found freedom. now you can go out and have the life you deserve!
@realdonaldtrump we are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our veterans.
@realdonaldtrump the deal with north korea is very much in the making and will be, if completed, a very good one for the world. time and place to be determined.
@realdonaldtrump rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are â€śsomewhat low.â€ť they know they are lying when they say it. turn off the show - fake news!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats continue to obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government...a record in u.s. history. state department, ambassadors and many others are being slow walked. senate must approve now!
@realdonaldtrump the republicans are 5-0 in recent congressional races, a point which the fake news media continuously fails to mention. i backed and campaigned for all of the winners. they give me credit for one. hopefully, rick saccone will be another big win on tuesday.
@realdonaldtrump ...have shown conclusively that there was no collusion with russia..just excuse for losing. the only collusion was that done by the dnc, the democrats and crooked hillary. the writer of the story, maggie haberman, a hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access.
@realdonaldtrump the failing new york times purposely wrote a false story stating that i am unhappy with my legal team on the russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. wrong. i am very happy with my lawyers, john dowd, thank you cobb and jay sekulow. they are doing a great job and.....

@realdonaldtrump if schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!

@realdonaldtrump very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by white house. legislation moving forward. bump stocks will soon be out. highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to state law. armed guards ok, deterrent!.......
@realdonaldtrump secretary of commerce wilbur ross will be speaking with representatives of the european union about eliminating the large tariffs and barriers they use against the u.s.a. not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.

@realdonaldtrump the fake news is beside themselves that mccabe was caught, called out and fired. how many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wifeâ€™s campaign by crooked h friend, terry m, who was also under investigation? how many lies? how many leaks? comey knew it all, and much more!
@realdonaldtrump as the house intelligence committee has concluded, there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign. as many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi, justice & state. #draintheswamp

@realdonaldtrump andrew mccabe fired, a great day for the hard working men and women of the fbi - a great day for democracy. sanctimonious james comey was his boss and made mccabe look like a choirboy. he knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the fbi!
@realdonaldtrump why does the mueller team have 13 hardened democrats, some big crooked hillary supporters, and zero republicans? another demonstrative recently added...does anyone think this is fair? and yet, there is no collusion!
@realdonaldtrump spent very little time with andrew mccabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. i donâ€™t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. same with lying james comey. can we call them fake memos?
@realdonaldtrump wow, watch comey lie under oath to senator gram when asked â€śhave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?â€ť he said strongly â€śnever, no.â€ť he lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
@realdonaldtrump the mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. it was based on fraudulent activities and a fake dossier paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc, and improperly used in fisa court for surveillance of my campaign. witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump a total witch hunt with massive conflicts of interest!

@realdonaldtrump i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, obama called him also). the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. they are wrong! getting along with russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing.......
@realdonaldtrump â€śspecial council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not. i was opposed to the selection of mueller to be special council. i am still opposed to it. i think president trump was right when he said there never should have been a special council appointed because.....

@realdonaldtrump democrats refused to take care of daca. would have been so easy, but they just didnâ€™t care. i had to fight for military and start of wall.
@realdonaldtrump got $1.6 billion to start wall on southern border, rest will be forthcoming. most importantly, got $700 billion to rebuild our military, $716 billion next year...most ever. had to waste money on demonstrative giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment.
@realdonaldtrump as a matter of national security i have signed the omnibus spending bill. i say to congress: i will never sign another bill like this again. to prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, i am calling on congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills! https://twitter.com/foxnews/status/977235839326609409â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump i am considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus daca recipients have been totally abandoned by the democrats (not even mentioned in bill) and the border wall, which is desperately needed for our national defense, is not fully funded.
@realdonaldtrump daca was abandoned by the democrats. very unfair to them! would have been tied to desperately needed wall.

@realdonaldtrump governor jerry â€śmoonbeamâ€ť brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) kidnapping and robbery (2) badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) dealing drugs. is this really what the great people of california want? @foxnews

@realdonaldtrump thank you to rasmussen for the honest polling. just hit 50%, which is higher than cheatinâ€™ obama at the same time in his administration.
@realdonaldtrump check out the fact that you canâ€™t get a job at ratings challenged @cnn unless you state that you are totally anti-trump? little jeff zuker, whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately. they should clean up and strengthen cnn and get back to honest reporting!
@realdonaldtrump the big caravan of people from honduras, now coming across mexico and heading to our â€śweak lawsâ€ť border, had better be stopped before it gets there. cash cow nafta is in play, as is foreign aid to honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. congress must act now!
@realdonaldtrump the fake news networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased agenda, are worried about the competition and quality of sinclair broadcast. the â€śfakersâ€ť at cnn, nbc, abc & cbs have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction!
@realdonaldtrump â€śpresident trump's approval rate among likely u.s. voters hit 50 percent on monday, which puts him higher than former president barack obama's score at the same point into his first term, according to a new poll.â€ť via: @anna_giaritelli @dcexaminer pic.twitter.com/zzycnodcqj
@realdonaldtrump 39% of my nominations, including diplomats to foreign lands, have not been confirmed due to democrat obstruction and delay. at this rate, it would take more than 7 years before i am allowed to have these great people start working. never happened before. disgraceful!
@realdonaldtrump honduras, mexico and many other countries that the u.s. is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our weak immigration policies. caravans are heading here. must pass tough laws and build the wall. democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime!
@realdonaldtrump as ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our southern border back where they came from. a whole big wasted procedure must take place. mexico & canada have tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an obama joke. act congress

@realdonaldtrump our thoughts and prayers are with the four u.s. marines from the third marine aircraft wing who lost their lives in yesterdayâ€™s southern california helicopter crash. we pray for their families, and our great @usmc.
@realdonaldtrump when youâ€™re already $500 billion down, you canâ€™t lose!
@realdonaldtrump we are not in a trade war with china, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the u.s. now we have a trade deficit of $500 billion a year, with intellectual property theft of another $300 billion. we cannot let this continue!
@realdonaldtrump our border laws are very weak while those of mexico & canada are very strong. congress must change these obama era, and other, laws now! the democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....crime! we will be taking strong action today.

@realdonaldtrump the fake news washington post, amazonâ€™s â€śchief lobbyist,â€ť has another (of many) phony headlines, â€śtrump defiant as china adds trade penalties.â€ť wrong! should read, â€śtrump defiant as u.s. adds trade penalties, will end barriers and massive i.p. theft.â€ť typically bad reporting!
@realdonaldtrump the caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our border. because of the trump administrations actions, border crossings are at a still unacceptable 46 year low. stop drugs!

@realdonaldtrump do you believe that the fake news media is pushing hard on a story that i am going to replace a.g. jeff sessions with epa chief scott pruitt, who is doing a great job but is totally under siege? do people really believe this stuff? so much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!
@realdonaldtrump china, which is a great economic power, is considered a developing nation within the world trade organization. they therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the u.s. does anybody think this is fair. we were badly represented. the wto is unfair to u.s.
@realdonaldtrump despite the aluminum tariffs, aluminum prices are down 4%. people are surprised, iâ€™m not! lots of money coming into u.s. coffers and jobs, jobs, jobs!
@realdonaldtrump fire at trump tower is out. very confined (well built building). firemen (and women) did a great job. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump what does the department of justice and fbi have to hide? why arenâ€™t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the house judiciary committee? stalling, but for what reason? not looking good!
@realdonaldtrump lawmakers of the house judiciary committee are angrily accusing the department of justice of missing the thursday deadline for turning over unredacted documents relating to fisa abuse, fbi, comey, lynch, mccabe, clinton emails and much more. slow walking - what is going on? bad!
@realdonaldtrump we are sealing up our southern border. the people of our great country want safety and security. the dems have been a disaster on this very important issue!
@realdonaldtrump the united states hasnâ€™t had a trade surplus with china in 40 years. they must end unfair trade, take down barriers and charge only reciprocal tariffs. the u.s. is losing $500 billion a year, and has been losing billions of dollars for decades. cannot continue!
@realdonaldtrump just spoke to @justintrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible humboldt team tragedy. may god be with them all!
@realdonaldtrump if president obama had crossed his stated red line in the sand, the syrian disaster would have ended long ago! animal assad would have been history!
@realdonaldtrump ....to pay. open area immediately for medical help and verification. another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever. sick!
@realdonaldtrump many dead, including women and children, in mindless chemical attack in syria. area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by syrian army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world. president putin, russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad. big price...
@realdonaldtrump president xi and i will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade. china will take down its trade barriers because it is the right thing to do. taxes will become reciprocal & a deal will be made on intellectual property. great future for both countries!
@realdonaldtrump the washington post is far more fiction than fact. story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. always quoting sources (not names), many of which donâ€™t exist. story on john kelly isnâ€™t true, just another hit job!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe fbi closed the case on hillary, which was a rigged investigation. they exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath.....â€ť and much more. so true jesse! @wattersworld
@realdonaldtrump while security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, scott pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at epa. record clean air & water while saving usa billions of dollars. rent was about market rate, travel expenses ok. scott is doing a great job!

@realdonaldtrump speaker paul ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. we are with you paul!
@realdonaldtrump much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake & corrupt russia investigation, headed up by the all democrat loyalists, or people that worked for obama. mueller is most conflicted of all (except rosenstein who signed fisa & comey letter). no collusion, so they go crazy!
@realdonaldtrump our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the cold war. there is no reason for this. russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. stop the arms race?
@realdonaldtrump russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria. get ready russia, because they will be coming, nice and new and â€śsmart!â€ť you shouldnâ€™t be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
@realdonaldtrump ....doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. no collusion or obstruction (other than i fight back), so now they do the unthinkable, and raid a lawyers office for information! bad!
@realdonaldtrump so much fake news about what is going on in the white house. very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with china, the coming north korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in syria. feels great to have bolton & larry k on board. i (we) are
@realdonaldtrump the failing new york times wrote another phony story. it was political pundit doug schoen, not a ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (skype), hosted by doug, in ukraine. i was very positive about ukraine-another negative to the fake russia c story!

@realdonaldtrump california governor jerry brown is doing the right thing and sending the national guard to the border. thank you jerry, good move for the safety of our country!
@realdonaldtrump if i wanted to fire robert mueller in december, as reported by the failing new york times, i would have fired him. just more fake news from a biased newspaper!

@realdonaldtrump james comey is a proven leaker & liar. virtually everyone in washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. he leaked classified information, for which he should be prosecuted. he lied to congress under oath. he is a weak and.....
@realdonaldtrump tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the border wall and an end to crime cradling sanctuary cities. started the wall in san diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it. they will soon be protected!
@realdonaldtrump would only join tpp if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to pres. obama. we already have bilateral deals with six of the eleven nations in tpp, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those nations, japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!
@realdonaldtrump so proud of our great military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our country has ever had. there wonâ€™t be anything, or anyone, even close!
@realdonaldtrump a perfectly executed strike last night. thank you to france and the united kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine military. could not have had a better result. mission accomplished!
@realdonaldtrump just hit 50% in the rasmussen poll, much higher than president obama at same point. with all of the phony stories and fake news, itâ€™s hard to believe! thank you america, we are doing great things.
@realdonaldtrump slippery james comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the worst fbi director in history, by far!
@realdonaldtrump attorney client privilege is now a thing of the past. i have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. all lawyers are deflated and concerned!
@realdonaldtrump i never asked comey for personal loyalty. i hardly even knew this guy. just another of his many lies. his â€śmemosâ€ť are self serving and fake!
@realdonaldtrump the syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the fake news media could demean was by my use of the term â€śmission accomplished.â€ť i knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great military term, it should be brought back. use often!
@realdonaldtrump comey throws ag lynch â€śunder the bus!â€ť why canâ€™t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with wild bill and lynch? was she promised a supreme court seat, or ag, in order to lay off hillary. no golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
@realdonaldtrump the big questions in comeyâ€™s badly reviewed book arenâ€™t answered like, how come he gave up classified information (jail), why did he lie to congress (jail), why did the dnc refuse to give server to the fbi (why didnâ€™t they take it), why the phony memos, mccabeâ€™s $700,000 & more?
@realdonaldtrump unbelievably, james comey states that polls, where crooked hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the clinton email probe. in other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. slimeball!
@realdonaldtrump russia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the u.s. keeps raising interest rates. not acceptable!
@realdonaldtrump comey drafted the crooked hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in congress to senator g), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. disgruntled, he, mccabe, and the others, committed many crimes!
@realdonaldtrump states and cities throughout our country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!
@realdonaldtrump ....congress â€“ house and senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. keep america safe!

@realdonaldtrump there is a revolution going on in california. soooo many sanctuary areas want out of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept. jerry brown is trying to back out of the national guard at the border, but the people of the state are not happy. want security & safety now!
@realdonaldtrump while japan and south korea would like us to go back into tpp, i donâ€™t like the deal for the united states. too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesnâ€™t work. bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for our workers. look how bad wto is to u.s.
@realdonaldtrump pastor andrew brunson, a fine gentleman and christian leader in the united states, is on trial and being persecuted in turkey for no reason. they call him a spy, but i am more a spy than he is. hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!

@realdonaldtrump my thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of the two @gcsoflorida deputies (heroes) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.
@realdonaldtrump mike pompeo is outstanding. first in his class at west point. a top student at harvard law school. a success at whatever he has done. we need the senate to approve mike asap. he will be a great secretary of state!
@realdonaldtrump ...hopefully the senate will not leave washington until our ambassadors, judges and the people who make washington work are approved. the democrats are obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our country!
@realdonaldtrump democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our government, hence, the american people. they are â€śslow walkingâ€ť all of my nominations - hundreds of people. at this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!

@realdonaldtrump thank you san diego county for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against california's illegal and unconstitutional 'sanctuary' policies. california's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all americans at risk.

@realdonaldtrump north korea has agreed to suspend all nuclear tests and close up a major test site. this is very good news for north korea and the world - big progress! look forward to our summit.

@realdonaldtrump james comey memos just out and show clearly that there was no collusion and no obstruction. also, he leaked classified information. wow! will the witch hunt continue?
@realdonaldtrump â€śat least two memos comey shared with a friend contained classified information.â€ť wall street journal
@realdonaldtrump the washington post said i refer to jeff sessions as â€śmr. magooâ€ť and rod rosenstein as â€śmr. peepers.â€ť this is â€śaccording to people with whom the president has spoken.â€ť there are no such people and donâ€™t know these characters...just more fake & disgusting news to create ill will!
@realdonaldtrump james comeyâ€™s memos are classified, i did not declassify them. they belong to our government! therefore, he broke the law! additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said i said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. where are memos on clinton, lynch & others?
@realdonaldtrump sylvester stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion jack johnson. his trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, i am considering a full pardon!

@realdonaldtrump ....non-existent â€śsourcesâ€ť and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who i have always liked & respected. most people will flip if the government lets them out of trouble, even if....
@realdonaldtrump the new york times and a third rate reporter named maggie haberman, known as a crooked h flunkie who i donâ€™t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy michael cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will â€śflip.â€ť they use....

@realdonaldtrump james comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a special council? therefore, the special council was established based on an illegal act? really, does everybody know what that means?
@realdonaldtrump thank you to the incredible law enforcement officers from the palm beach county sheriffâ€™s office. they keep us safe and are very cool about it! pic.twitter.com/nlhxppwmzt
@realdonaldtrump kim strassel of the wsj just said, after reviewing the dumb comey memos, â€śyou got to ask, what was the purpose of the special counsel? thereâ€™s no there there.â€ť daniel henninger of the wsj said memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!
@realdonaldtrump funny how all of the pundits that couldnâ€™t come close to making a deal on north korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!

@realdonaldtrump ....we are a long way from conclusion on north korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they wonâ€™t - only time will tell....but the work i am doing now should have been done a long time ago!
@realdonaldtrump sleepy eyes chuck todd of fake news nbc just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with north korea, and they have given up nothing. wow, we havenâ€™t given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for world), site closure, & no more testing!

@realdonaldtrump mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through mexico and into the u.s. we may make this a condition of the new nafta agreement. our country cannot accept what is happening! also, we must get wall funding fast.
@realdonaldtrump despite the democrat inspired laws on sanctuary cities and the border being so bad and one sided, i have instructed the secretary of homeland security not to let these large caravans of people into our country. it is a disgrace. we are the only country in the world so naive! wall

@realdonaldtrump the u.s. has put together a strong bid w/ canada & mexico for the 2026 world cup. it would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the u.s. bid. why should we be supporting these countries when they donâ€™t support us (including at the united nations)?

@realdonaldtrump please do not forget the great help that my good friend, president xi of china, has given to the united states, particularly at the border of north korea. without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process!

@realdonaldtrump after a furious year of missile launches and nuclear testing, a historic meeting between north and south korea is now taking place. good things are happening, but only time will tell!
@realdonaldtrump is everybody believing what is going on. james comey canâ€™t define what a leak is. he illegally leaked classified information but doesnâ€™t understand what he did or how serious it is. he lied all over the place to cover it up. heâ€™s either very sick or very dumb. remember sailor!

@realdonaldtrump secret service has just informed me that senator jon testerâ€™s statements on admiral jackson are not true. there were no such findings. a horrible thing that we in d.c. must live with, just like phony russian collusion. tester should lose race in montana. very dishonest and sick!
@realdonaldtrump look forward to being in the great state of michigan tonight. major business expansion and jobs pouring into your state. auto companies expanding at record pace. big crowd tonight, will be live on t.v.
@realdonaldtrump just had a long and very good talk with president moon of south korea. things are going very well, time and location of meeting with north korea is being set. also spoke to prime minister abe of japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations.

@realdonaldtrump allegations made by senator jon tester against admiral/doctor ron jackson are proving false. the secret service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful jackson family. tester should resign. the.....
@realdonaldtrump house intelligence committee rules that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia. as i have been saying all along, it is all a big hoax by the democrats based on payments and lies. there should never have been a special counsel appointed. witch hunt!

@realdonaldtrump while washington, michigan, was a big success, washington, d.c., just didnâ€™t work. everyone is talking about the fact that the white house correspondents dinner was a very big, boring bust...the so-called comedian really â€śbombed.â€ť @greggutfeld should host next year! @petehegseth
@realdonaldtrump great evening last night in washington, michigan. the enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal. to the many thousands of people who couldnâ€™t get in, i cherish you....and will be back!
@realdonaldtrump the white house is running very smoothly despite phony witch hunts etcetera. there is great energy and unending stamina, both necessary to get things done. we are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! fake news is going â€śbonkers!â€ť
@realdonaldtrump the fake news is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who donâ€™t exist). they are totally unhinged, and the great success of this administration is making them do and say things that even they canâ€™t believe they are saying. truly bad people!
@realdonaldtrump during small business week, we celebrate the great, hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!
@realdonaldtrump the migrant â€caravanâ€™ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective u.s. immigration laws are. yet democrats like jon tester continue to support the open borders agenda â€“ tester even voted to protect sanctuary cities. we need lawmakers who will put america first.

@realdonaldtrump the white house correspondentsâ€™ dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. the filthy â€ścomedianâ€ť totally bombed (couldnâ€™t even deliver her lines-much like the seth meyers weak performance). put dinner to rest, or start over!

@realdonaldtrump so disgraceful that the questions concerning the russian witch hunt were â€śleakedâ€ť to the media. no questions on collusion. oh, i see...you have a made up, phony crime, collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. nice!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthis isnâ€™t some game. you are screwing with the work of the president of the united states.â€ť john dowd, march 2018. with north korea, china, the middle east and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no russian â€ścollusion.â€ť

@realdonaldtrump there was no collusion (it is a hoax) and there is no obstruction of justice (that is a setup & trap). what there is is negotiations going on with north korea over nuclear war, negotiations going on with china over trade deficits, negotiations on nafta, and much more. witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump this spring marks 4yrs since the phoenix va crisis. we won't forget what happened to our great vets. choice is vital, but the program needs work & is running out of $. congress must fix choice program by memorial day so vets can get the care they deserve. i will sign immediately!

@realdonaldtrump the republican party had a great night. tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in november. the economy is sooo strong, and with nancy pelosi wanting to end the big tax cuts and raise taxes, why wouldnâ€™t we win?

@realdonaldtrump nebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and vote for debate fischer today! https://twitter.com/debfischerne/status/996371820512194560â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories i get from the fake news media, together with the $10,000,000 russian witch hunt (there is no collusion), i now have my best poll numbers in a year. much of the media may be corrupt, but the people truly get it!
@realdonaldtrump trade negotiations are continuing with china. they have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the u.s., for many years. stay tuned!
@realdonaldtrump our great first lady is doing really well. will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. thank you for so much love and support!
@realdonaldtrump gina haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the cia. she is exceptionally qualified and the senate should confirm her immediately. we need her to keep our great country safe! #confirmgina
@realdonaldtrump ...and voted against the massive tax cut bill. heâ€™s also weak on borders and crime. sadly, our great military and vets mean nothing to bobby jr. lou barletta will win! #maga
@realdonaldtrump lou barletta will be a great senator for pennsylvania but his opponent, bob casey, has been a do-nothing senator who only shows up at election time. he votes along the nancy pelosi, elizabeth warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare...
@realdonaldtrump today, it was my great honor to welcome president mirziyoyev of uzbekistan to the @whitehouse! pic.twitter.com/3ekhchjnya
@realdonaldtrump house votes today on choice/mission act. who will stand with our great vets, caregivers, and veterans service organizations? must get choice passed by memorial day!
@realdonaldtrump ...havenâ€™t even started yet! the u.s. has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years. china has much to give!
@realdonaldtrump ...we have not seen chinaâ€™s demands yet, which should be few in that previous u.s. administrations have done so poorly in negotiating. china has seen our demands. there has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings...
@realdonaldtrump the washington post and cnn have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with china. nothing has happened with zte except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with china...
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to debate fischer. the people of nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! #maga
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to lou barletta of pennsylvania. he will be a great senator and will represent his people well - like they havenâ€™t been represented in many years. lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump it was my great honor to visit with our heroes last night at walter reed medical center. there is nobody like them! pic.twitter.com/fg5w1swihk

@realdonaldtrump congrats to the house for passing the va mission act yesterday. without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. putting politics over our veterans care is unacceptable â€“ senate must vote yes on this bill by memorial day!
@realdonaldtrump despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted witch hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month administration in u.s. history - by far! sorry to the fake news media and â€śhaters,â€ť but thatâ€™s the way it is!
@realdonaldtrump wow, word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi â€śspied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant.â€ť andrew mccarthy says, â€śthereâ€™s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.â€ť if so, this is bigger than watergate!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations america, we are now into the second year of the greatest witch hunt in american history...and there is still no collusion and no obstruction. the only collusion was that done by democrats who were unable to win an election despite the spending of far more money!
@realdonaldtrump america is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal. we have ended the war on coal, and will continue to work to promote american energy dominance!
@realdonaldtrump california finally deserves a great governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes. john cox is the man - heâ€™ll be the best governor youâ€™ve ever had. i fully endorse john cox for governor and look forward to working with him to make california great again!
@realdonaldtrump just met with un secretary-general antăłnio guterres who is working hard to â€śmake the united nations great again.â€ť when the un does more to solve conflicts around the world, it means the u.s. has less to do and we save money. @nikkihaley is doing a fantastic job! pic.twitter.com/pquv6cyh2z

@realdonaldtrump we grieve for the terrible loss of life, and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in texas. to the students, families, teachers and personnel at santa fe high school â€“ we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever... pic.twitter.com/ltj0d29hsv
@realdonaldtrump school shooting in texas. early reports not looking good. god bless all!
@realdonaldtrump reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. it took place very early on, and long before the phony russia hoax became a â€śhotâ€ť fake news story. if true - all time biggest political scandal!
@realdonaldtrump why isnâ€™t disgraced fbi official andrew mccabe being investigated for the $700,000 crooked hillary democrats in virginia, led by clinton best friend terry m (under fbi investigation that they killed) gave to mccabeâ€™s wife in her run for office? then dropped case on clinton!
@realdonaldtrump fake news media had me calling immigrants, or illegal immigrants, â€śanimals.â€ť wrong! they were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. i referred to ms 13 gang members as â€śanimals,â€ť a big difference - and so true. fake news got it purposely wrong, as usual!
@realdonaldtrump â€śapparently the doj put a spy in the trump campaign. this has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame donald trump for crimes he didnâ€™t commit.â€ť david asman @loudobbs @greggjarrett really bad stuff!
@realdonaldtrump if the fbi or doj was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. only the release or review of documents that the house intelligence committee (also, senate judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. drain the swamp!
@realdonaldtrump great to have our incredible first lady back home in the white house. melania is feeling and doing really well. thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
@realdonaldtrump happy #armedforcesday to our great military men and women for their selfless service to our nation! pic.twitter.com/jbjvrkv1hh
@realdonaldtrump i hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the department of justice look into whether or not the fbi/doj infiltrated or surveilled the trump campaign for political purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the obama administration!
@realdonaldtrump the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now theyâ€™re looking at the rest of the world. ohâ€™ great!
@realdonaldtrump ....and why hasnâ€™t the podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? is it because he is a very well connected democrat working in the swamp of washington, d.c.?
@realdonaldtrump what ever happened to the server, at the center of so much corruption, that the democratic national committee refused to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of democrats) fbi? they broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the server?
@realdonaldtrump now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world, they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party. donâ€™t worry about dems fisa abuse, missing emails or fraudulent dossier!
@realdonaldtrump ...in the hillary clinton campaign where she deleted 33,000 emails, got $145,000,000 while secretary of state, paid mccabes wife $700,000 (and got off the fbi hook along with terry m) and so much more. republicans and real americans should start getting tough on this scam.
@realdonaldtrump ....at what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 witch hunt, composed of 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for 8 years, stop! they have found no collussion with russia, no obstruction, but they arenâ€™t looking at the corruption...
@realdonaldtrump things are really getting ridiculous. the failing and crooked (but not as crooked as hillary clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the worldâ€™s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the world!
@realdonaldtrump .@asahutchinson, the great governor of arkansas, is in a primary tomorrow. he has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes, border security, and crime prevention. asa loves our military and our veterans. i fully endorse asa for governor!
@realdonaldtrump under our potential deal with china, they will purchase from our great american farmers practically as much as our farmers can produce.
@realdonaldtrump the wall street journal asks, â€śwhere in the world was barack obama?â€ť a very good question!
@realdonaldtrump ...they then used to start an investigation about trump. it is that simple. this guy is the genesis of this whole debacle. this was a political hit job, this was not an intelligence investigation. brennan has disgraced himself, heâ€™s worried about staying out of jail.â€ť daniel bongino
@realdonaldtrump ....top of the fbi. brennan started this entire debacle about president trump. we now know that brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) dossier...he knows about the dossier, he denies knowledge of the dossier, he briefs the gang of 8 on the hill about the dossier, which....
@realdonaldtrump â€śjohn brennan is panicking. he has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the country, he has disgraced the entire intelligence community. he is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of americanâ€™s faith in the intelligence community and in some people at the....
@realdonaldtrump china must continue to be strong & tight on the border of north korea until a deal is made. the word is that recently the border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. i want this to happen, and north korea to be very successful, but only after signing!
@realdonaldtrump on china, barriers and tariffs to come down for first time.
@realdonaldtrump china has agreed to buy massive amounts of additional farm/agricultural products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
@realdonaldtrump i ask senator chuck schumer, why didnâ€™t president obama & the democrats do something about trade with china, including theft of intellectual property etc.? they did nothing! with that being said, chuck & i have long agreed on this issue! fair trade, plus, with china will happen!

@realdonaldtrump there will be big news coming soon for our great american autoworkers. after many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!
@realdonaldtrump big legislation will be signed by me shortly. after many years, right to try and big changes to dodd frank.
@realdonaldtrump our trade deal with china is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.
@realdonaldtrump â€śtrump should be happy that the fbi was spying on his campaignâ€ť no, james clapper, i am not happy. spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!
@realdonaldtrump everybody is with tomi lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends
@realdonaldtrump spygate could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
@realdonaldtrump â€śitâ€™s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the trump campaignâ€ť judge andrew napolitano
@realdonaldtrump look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state. they go after phony collusion with russia, a made up scam, and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! what goes around, comes around!
@realdonaldtrump @foxandfriends â€śnew bombshell in the obama spying scandal. did other agencies spy on trump campaign?â€ť even clapper, worlds dumbest former intelligence head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word spy when describing the illegal activities!
@realdonaldtrump ...follow the money! the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia, because there was no collusion. he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders, who got duped!
@realdonaldtrump if the person placed very early into my campaign wasnâ€™t a spy put there by the previous administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...

@realdonaldtrump not surprisingly, the great men & women of the fbi are starting to speak out against comey, mccabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the fbi. comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the fbi! #spygate
@realdonaldtrump clapper has now admitted that there was spying in my campaign. large dollars were paid to the spy, far beyond normal. starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in u.s. history. spygate - a terrible thing!
@realdonaldtrump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 a.m. enjoy!

@realdonaldtrump ...but complain and obstruct. they made only bad deals (iran) and their so-called trade deals are the laughing stock of the world!
@realdonaldtrump senator schumer and obama administration let phone company zte flourish with no security checks. i closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase u.s. parts and pay a $1.3 billion fine. dems do nothing....
@realdonaldtrump funny to watch the democrats criticize trade deals being negotiated by me when they donâ€™t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the obama administration did nothing on trade except let other countries rip off the united states. lost almost $800 billion/year under â€śoâ€ť
@realdonaldtrump chicago police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just wonâ€™t let them do their job. the killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!

@realdonaldtrump very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from north korea. we will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. only time (and talent) will tell!
@realdonaldtrump democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with north korea. just like they are coming to the defense of ms 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big tax cuts & raise your taxes instead. dems have lost touch!
@realdonaldtrump â€śeveryone knows there was a spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the spying are admitting that there was a spy...widespread spying involving multiple people.â€ť mollie hemingway, the federalist senior editor but the corrupt mainstream media hates this monster story!
@realdonaldtrump can anyone even imagine having spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? and to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, lost!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing partyâ€™s campaign is different than having a spy, as illegal as that may be. but what about an â€śinformantâ€ť who is paid a fortune and who â€śsets upâ€ť way earlier than the russian hoax?
@realdonaldtrump when will the 13 angry democrats (& those who worked for president o), reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest? itâ€™s been a long time now! will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems, justice, fbi & russia?
@realdonaldtrump this whole russia probe is rigged. just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that havenâ€™t been lost in decades. 13 angry democrats, and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for 8 years. #spygate & conflicts of interest!
@realdonaldtrump with spies, or â€śinformantsâ€ť as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but itâ€™s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didnâ€™t the crooked highest levels of the fbi or â€śjusticeâ€ť contact me to tell me of the phony russia problem?
@realdonaldtrump the failing @nytimes quotes â€śa senior white house official,â€ť who doesnâ€™t exist, as saying â€śeven if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on june 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.â€ť wrong again! use real people, not phony sources.
@realdonaldtrump unlike what the failing and corrupt new york times would like people to believe, there is zero disagreement within the trump administration as to how to deal with north korea...and if there was, it wouldnâ€™t matter. the @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!
@realdonaldtrump thanks to very brave teacher & hero jason seaman of noblesville, indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. his quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!
@realdonaldtrump looking forward to seeing joshua holt this evening in the white house. the great people of utah are celebrating!
@realdonaldtrump put pressure on the democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the border into the u.s. catch and release, lottery and chain must also go with it and we must continue building the wall! democrats are protecting ms-13 thugs.
@realdonaldtrump good news about the release of the american hostage from venezuela. should be landing in d.c. this evening and be in the white house, with his family, at about 7:00 p.m. the great people of utah will be very happy!
@realdonaldtrump we are having very productive talks with north korea about reinstating the summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in singapore on the same date, june 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.
@realdonaldtrump why didnâ€™t president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election? because he thought crooked hillary was going to win, and he didnâ€™t want to upset the apple cart! he was in charge, not me, and did nothing.
@realdonaldtrump our united states team has arrived in north korea to make arrangements for the summit between kim jong un and myself. i truly believe north korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial nation one day. kim jong un agrees with me on this. it will happen!
@realdonaldtrump why didnâ€™t the 13 angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton, many crimes, much collusion with russia? why didnâ€™t the fbi take the server from the dnc? rigged investigation!
@realdonaldtrump fantastic to have 400,000 great men & women of rolling thunder in d.c. showing their patriotism. they love our country, they love our flag, they stand for our national anthem! thanks to executive director artie muller.
@realdonaldtrump whoâ€™s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt? they journeyed down to washington, d.c., with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...they went back home in tatters!

@realdonaldtrump california has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others. on june 5th., vote for gop gubernatorial candidate john cox, a really good and highly competent man. heâ€™ll make california great again!
@realdonaldtrump a democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to repeal the gop tax cuts (no chance). this is too good to be true for republicans...remember, the nancy pelosi dems are also weak on crime, the border and want to be gentle and kind to ms-13 gang members...not good!

@realdonaldtrump the fake mainstream media has, from the time i announced i was running for president, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest disinformation campaign in the history of politics. no matter how well we do, they find fault. but the forgotten men & women won, iâ€™m president!
@realdonaldtrump sorry, iâ€™ve got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear, bad trade deals, va choice, the economy, rebuilding the military, and so much more, and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clinton/russia/fbi/justice/obama/comey/lynch etcetera.
@realdonaldtrump why arenâ€™t the 13 angry and heavily conflicted democrats investigating the totally crooked campaign of totally crooked hillary clinton. itâ€™s a rigged witch hunt, thatâ€™s why! ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
@realdonaldtrump the 13 angry democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for obama) working on the rigged russia witch hunt, will be meddling with the mid-term elections, especially now that republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in polls. there was no collusion, except by the democrats!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthis investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. it wasnâ€™t just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the trump campaign...people call that spying...this is unprecedented and scandalous.â€ť mollie hemingway
@realdonaldtrump we have put a great team together for our talks with north korea. meetings are currently taking place concerning summit, and more. kim young chol, the vice chairman of north korea, heading now to new york. solid response to my letter, thank you!
@realdonaldtrump democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from obamaâ€™s term showing children from the border in steel cages. they thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. dems must agree to wall and new border protection for good of country...bipartisan bill!
@realdonaldtrump there is no one better to represent the people of n.y. and staten island (a place i know very well) than @repdandonovan, who is strong on borders & crime, loves our military & our vets, voted for tax cuts and is helping me to make america great again. daniel has my full endorsement!

@realdonaldtrump the failing and corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at â€ś1000 people,â€ť when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockinâ€™. this is the way they demean and disparage. they are very dishonest people who donâ€™t â€śgetâ€ť me, and never did!

@realdonaldtrump rep.trey gowdy, â€śi donâ€™t think so, i think what the president is doing is expressing frustration that attorney general sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward. if i were the president and i picked someone to be the countryâ€™s....

@realdonaldtrump very good meetings with north korea.
@realdonaldtrump not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia! the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!
@realdonaldtrump the corrupt mainstream media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, spies (informants), into my campaign! surveillance much?
@realdonaldtrump iger, where is my call of apology? you and abc have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. how is brian ross doing? he tanked the market with an abc lie, yet no apology. double standard!
@realdonaldtrump rush limbaugh â€śif the fbi was so concerned, and if they werenâ€™t targeting trump, they should have told trump. if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? why not tell trump? because they were pushing this scam.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe recusal of jeff sessions was an unforced betrayal of the president of the united states.â€ť joe digenova, former u.s. attorney.
@realdonaldtrump the soon to be released book, â€śthe russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump,â€ť written by gregg jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit. the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see! out in 5 weeks.
@realdonaldtrump very importantly, @repdandonovan will win for the republicans in november...and his opponent will not. remember alabama. we canâ€™t take any chances on losing to a nancy pelosi controlled democrat!
@realdonaldtrump today, it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the united states coast guard! pic.twitter.com/raypbogxuz
@realdonaldtrump canada has treated our agricultural business and farmers very poorly for a very long period of time. highly restrictive on trade! they must open their markets and take down their trade barriers! they report a really high surplus on trade with us. do timber & lumber in u.s.?
@realdonaldtrump looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning.
@realdonaldtrump why arenâ€™t they firing no talent samantha bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? a total double standard but thatâ€™s o.k., we are winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!
@realdonaldtrump a.p. has just reported that the russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. no collusion, except by the democrats!
@realdonaldtrump when youâ€™re almost 800 billion dollars a year down on trade, you canâ€™t lose a trade war! the u.s. has been ripped off by other countries for years on trade, time to get smart!
@realdonaldtrump why is it that the wall street journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the tariffs routinely charged against the u.s. by other countries, or the many billions of dollars that the tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into u.s. coffers?
@realdonaldtrump the united states must, at long last, be treated fairly on trade. if we charge a country zero to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is unfair and can no longer be tolerated. that is not free or fair trade, it is stupid trade!
@realdonaldtrump there was no collusion with russia (except by the democrats). when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end? so bad for our country. is the special counsel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media? should be looking at dems corruption instead?
@realdonaldtrump real @foxnews is doing great, fake news cnn is dead! https://twitter.com/robbystarbuck/status/1001949868460593152â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump ....â€ś$17 million spent, itâ€™s a scam investigation. americans are being worked. we now know there was russian collusion, with russians and the democrats. the mueller team is stacked with anti-trumpers, who actually represented clinton people (& gave $â€™s to crooked h).â€ť daniel bongino
@realdonaldtrump â€śjohn brennan, no single figure in american history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. not only is he a liar, heâ€™s a liar about being a liar.â€ť daniel bongino on @foxandfriends
@realdonaldtrump â€śwe ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are.â€ť neil irwin of the @nytimes.
@realdonaldtrump mark penn â€śwhy are there people from the clinton foundation on the mueller staff? why is there an independent counsel? to go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...constitution was set up to prevent this...stormtrooper tactics almost.â€ť a disgrace!
@realdonaldtrump ....paul manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented ronald reagan, bob dole & many others over the years), but we should have been told that comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldnâ€™t have been hired!
@realdonaldtrump as only one of two people left who could become president, why wouldnâ€™t the fbi or department of â€śjusticeâ€ť have told me that they were secretly investigating paul manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign? should have told me!
@realdonaldtrump jesse watters â€śthe only thing trump obstructed was hillary getting to the white house.â€ť so true!
@realdonaldtrump in many ways this is the greatest economy in the history of america and the best time ever to look for a job!
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt.

@realdonaldtrump the appointment of the special counsel is totally unconstitutional! despite that, we play the game because i, unlike the democrats, have done nothing wrong!
@realdonaldtrump farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. mexico, canada, china and others have treated them unfairly. by the time i finish trade talks, that will change. big trade barriers against u.s. farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken. massive trade deficits no longer!
@realdonaldtrump the u.s. has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only win!
@realdonaldtrump china already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans. canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our agricultural products. not acceptable!
@realdonaldtrump as has been stated by numerous legal scholars, i have the absolute right to pardon myself, but why would i do that when i have done nothing wrong? in the meantime, the never ending witch hunt, led by 13 very angry and conflicted democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthis is the best time ever to look for a job.â€ť james freeman of wsj.
@realdonaldtrump ....we had repeal & replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway. individual mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month. drug prices coming down & right to try!
@realdonaldtrump this is my 500th. day in office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any president in his first 500 days. massive tax & regulation cuts, military & vets, lower crime & illegal immigration, stronger borders, judgeships, best economy & jobs ever, and much more...
@realdonaldtrump imagine how much wasteful spending weâ€™d save if we didnâ€™t have chuck and nancy standing in our way! for years, democrats in congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending, and to what end? no more.
@realdonaldtrump the historic rescissions package weâ€™ve proposed would cut $15,000,000,000 in wasteful spending! we are getting our government back on track.
@realdonaldtrump terrific new book out by the wonderful harris faulkner, â€ś9 rules of engagement.â€ť harris shares lessons from a military family. enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump senator @rogerwicker of mississippi has done everything necessary to make america great again! get out and vote for roger, he has my total support!
@realdonaldtrump vote for congressman devin nunes, a true american patriot the likes of which we rarely see in our modern day world....he truly loves our country and deserves everyoneâ€™s support!
@realdonaldtrump get the vote out in california today for rep. kevin mccarthy and all of the great gop candidates for congress. keep our country out of the hands of high tax, high crime nancy pelosi.
@realdonaldtrump in high tax, high crime california, be sure to get out and vote for republican john cox for governor. he will make a big difference!
@realdonaldtrump separating families at the border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the democrats. border security laws should be changed but the dems canâ€™t get their act together! started the wall.
@realdonaldtrump ....@nascar and champion @martintruex_jr were recently at the white house. it was a great day for a great sport!
@realdonaldtrump meeting in singapore with north korea will hopefully be the start of something big...we will soon see!
@realdonaldtrump the russian witch hunt hoax continues, all because jeff sessions didnâ€™t tell me he was going to recuse himself...i would have quickly picked someone else. so much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined...and sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion!
@realdonaldtrump we have had many championship teams recently at the white house including the chicago cubs, houston astros, pittsburgh penguins, new england patriots, alabama and clemson national champions, and many others. national anthem & more great music today at 3:00 p.m.
@realdonaldtrump we will proudly be playing the national anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our country today at 3 p.m., the white house, with the united states marine band and the united states army chorus. honoring america! nfl, no escaping to locker rooms!
@realdonaldtrump the u.s. has an increased economic value of more than 7 trillion dollars since the election. may be the best economy in the history of our country. record jobs numbers. nice!
@realdonaldtrump what is taking so long with the inspector generalâ€™s report on crooked hillary and slippery james comey. numerous delays. hope report is not being changed and made weaker! there are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. transparency!
@realdonaldtrump the philadelphia eagles football team was invited to the white house. unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. staying in the locker room for the playing of our national anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. sorry!

@realdonaldtrump congratulations to dana rohrabacher on his big california win. we are proud of you dana!
@realdonaldtrump many more republican voters showed up yesterday than the fake news thought possible. the political pundits just donâ€™t get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! remember, dems are high tax, high crime, easy to beat!
@realdonaldtrump ...four reporters spotted melania in the white house last week walking merrily along to a meeting. they never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever. fake news is really bad!
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great first lady, melania. during her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the w.h. (and me) for n.y. or virginia, to abuse. all fake, she is doing really well!
@realdonaldtrump gold star father, ceejay metcalf, whose great son michael was just honored at the white house, was fantastic this morning on @foxandfriends. he is a special man!
@realdonaldtrump great night for republicans! congratulations to john cox on a really big number in california. he can win. even fake news cnn said the trump impact was really big, much bigger than they ever thought possible. so much for the big blue wave, it may be a big red wave. working hard!
@realdonaldtrump mitch mcconnell announced he will cancel the senateâ€™s august recess. great, maybe the democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of high crime and high taxes. we need border security!
@realdonaldtrump ....the greatest witch hunt in political history!
@realdonaldtrump ...this is a level of criminality beyond the pale. this is such a grave abuse of power and authority, itâ€™s like nothing else weâ€™ve seen in our history. this makes the nixon watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
@realdonaldtrump chris farrell, judicial watch. â€śthey were running an operation to undermine a candidate for president of the u.s. these are all violations of law. this is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. thereâ€™s nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...
@realdonaldtrump great interview by @loudobbs with chris farrell of judicial watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign. spygate at the highest level. who would believe?
@realdonaldtrump wow, strzok-page, the incompetent & corrupt fbi lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the trump campaign dating way back to december, 2015. spygate is in full force! is the mainstream media interested yet? big stuff!
@realdonaldtrump prime minister trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the u.s. and canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesnâ€™t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy â€” hurting our farmers, killing our agriculture!
@realdonaldtrump please tell prime minister trudeau and president macron that they are charging the u.s. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. the eu trade surplus with the u.s. is $151 billion, and canada keeps our farmers and others out. look forward to seeing them tomorrow.

@realdonaldtrump the obama administration is now accused of trying to give iran secret access to the financial system of the united states. this is totally illegal. perhaps we could get the 13 angry democrats to divert some of their energy to this â€śmatterâ€ť (as comey would call it). investigate!
@realdonaldtrump when will people start saying, â€śthank you, mr. president, for firing james comey?â€ť
@realdonaldtrump our justice department must not let awan & debbie wasserman schultz off the hook. the democrat i.t. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. they want to make a â€śplea dealâ€ť to hide what is on their server. where is server? really bad!
@realdonaldtrump looking forward to seeing my friend prime minister @abeshinzo of japan at noon. will be discussing north korea and trade.
@realdonaldtrump how could jeff flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own senate seat without even a fight (and who doesnâ€™t have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again? letâ€™s face it, heâ€™s a flake!
@realdonaldtrump when and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 angry democrats (plus) working on the witch hunt hoax. there has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. it is all a democrat excuse for losing the election. where is the server?
@realdonaldtrump alan dershowitz, harvard law professor: â€śit all proves that we never needed a special counsel....all of this could have been done by the justice dept. donâ€™t need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someoneâ€™s back. not the way justice should operate.â€ť so true!
@realdonaldtrump good luck to alice johnson. have a wonderful life!
@realdonaldtrump isnâ€™t it ironic? getting ready to go to the g-7 in canada to fight for our country on trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to singapore to meet with north korea & the nuclear problem...but back home we still have the 13 angry democrats pushing the witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump i am heading for canada and the g-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the united states. from there i go to singapore and talks with north korea on denuclearization. wonâ€™t be talking about the russian witch hunt hoax for a while!

@realdonaldtrump canada charges the u.s. a 270% tariff on dairy products! they didnâ€™t tell you that, did they? not fair to our farmers!
@realdonaldtrump obama, schumer and pelosi did nothing about north korea, and now weak on crime, high tax schumer is telling me what to do at the summit the dems could never set up. schumer failed with north korea and iran, we donâ€™t need his advice!
@realdonaldtrump why isnâ€™t the european union and canada informing the public that for years they have used massive trade tariffs and non-monetary trade barriers against the u.s. totally unfair to our farmers, workers & companies. take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!
@realdonaldtrump pm justin trudeau of canada acted so meek and mild during our @g7 meetings only to give a news conference after i left saying that, â€śus tariffs were kind of insultingâ€ť and he â€świll not be pushed around.â€ť very dishonest & weak. our tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!
@realdonaldtrump based on justinâ€™s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that canada is charging massive tariffs to our u.s. farmers, workers and companies, i have instructed our u.s. reps not to endorse the communique as we look at tariffs on automobiles flooding the u.s. market!

@realdonaldtrump ....and add to that the fact that the u.s. pays close to the entire cost of nato-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). the european union had a $151 billion surplus-should pay much more for military!
@realdonaldtrump why should i, as president of the united states, allow countries to continue to make massive trade surpluses, as they have for decades, while our farmers, workers & taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? not fair to the people of america! $800 billion trade deficit...
@realdonaldtrump fair trade is now to be called fool trade if it is not reciprocal. according to a canada release, they make almost 100 billion dollars in trade with u.s. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). minimum is 17b. tax dairy from us at 270%. then justin acts hurt when called out!

@realdonaldtrump so funny to watch the fake news, especially nbc and cnn. they are fighting hard to downplay the deal with north korea. 500 days ago they would have â€śbeggedâ€ť for this deal-looked like war would break out. our countryâ€™s biggest enemy is the fake news so easily promulgated by fools!

@realdonaldtrump so, the democrats make up a phony crime, collusion with the russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (comey) classified information so that a special councel will be appointed, and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news!
@realdonaldtrump now that i am back from singapore, where we had a great result with respect to north korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the witch hunt, always remembering that there was no collusion and no obstruction of the fabricated no crime.
@realdonaldtrump the republican party is starting to show very big numbers. people are starting to see what is being done. results are speaking loudly. north korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way!
@realdonaldtrump great discussions with european union commission president jean-claude juncker and eu council president donald tusk at the #g7summit in canada last week. pic.twitter.com/kgxxe50459
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media said that i did not get along with other leaders at the #g7summit in canada. they are once again, wrong! pic.twitter.com/i6eekezv6z
@realdonaldtrump i have a great relationship with angela merkel of germany, but the fake news media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where i am asking for things that no other american president would ask for! pic.twitter.com/ib97nn5hzt
@realdonaldtrump iâ€™ve had to beat 17 very talented people including the bush dynasty, then i had to beat the clinton dynasty, and now i have to beat a phony witch hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the ig report...and never forget the fake news media. it never ends!
@realdonaldtrump wow, what a tough sentence for paul manafort, who has represented ronald reagan, bob dole and many other top political people and campaigns. didnâ€™t know manafort was the head of the mob. what about comey and crooked hillary and all of the others? very unfair!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. any immigration bill must have full funding for the wall, end catch & release, visa lottery and chain, and go to merit based immigration. go for it! win!
@realdonaldtrump â€śdonald trump was 100% right to fire james comey.â€ť mark levin
@realdonaldtrump â€śwhy in the world didnâ€™t barack obama fire this guy (comey)?â€ť asks mark levin!
@realdonaldtrump wow, the highest rated (by far) morning show, @foxandfriends, is on the front lawn of the white house. maybe iâ€™ll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?
@realdonaldtrump u.s.a. jobs numbers are the best in 44 years. if my opponent (the democrats) had won the election, they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy, and jobs, would have been a disaster!
@realdonaldtrump thank you for all of the compliments on getting the world cup to come to the u.s.a., mexico and canada. i worked hard on this, along with a great team of talented people. we never fail, and it will be a great world cup! a special thanks to bob kraft for excellent advice.
@realdonaldtrump the ig report is a total disaster for comey, his minions and sadly, the fbi. comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the fbi. i did a great service to the people in firing him. good instincts. christopher wray will bring it proudly back!
@realdonaldtrump fbi agent peter strzok, who headed the clinton & russia investigations, texted to his lover lisa page, in the ig report, that â€śweâ€™ll stopâ€ť candidate trump from becoming president. doesnâ€™t get any lower than that!
@realdonaldtrump the ig report totally destroys james comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, peter strzok and lisa page, who started the disgraceful witch hunt against so many innocent people. it will go down as a dark and dangerous period in american history!
@realdonaldtrump my supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. it is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. as we get stronger, so does our country. best numbers ever!
@realdonaldtrump democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the border by working with republicans on new legislation, for a change! this is why we need more republicans elected in november. democrats are good at only three things, high taxes, high crime and obstruction. sad!
@realdonaldtrump witch hunt! there was no russian collusion. oh, i see, there was no russian collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion. the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax. too bad they didnâ€™t look at crooked hillary like this. double standard!
@realdonaldtrump washington post employees want to go on strike because bezos isnâ€™t paying them enough. i think a really long strike would be a great idea. employees would get more money and we would get rid of fake news for an extended period of time! is @wapo a registered lobbyist?
@realdonaldtrump our economy is perhaps better than it has ever been. companies doing really well, and moving back to america, and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years.
@realdonaldtrump the denuclearization deal with north korea is being praised and celebrated all over asia. they are so happy! over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions & millions of lives!
@realdonaldtrump holding back the â€śwar gamesâ€ť during the negotiations was my request because they are very expensive and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. also, quite provocative. can start up immediately if talks break down, which i hope will not happen!
@realdonaldtrump funny how the fake news, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say i gave sooo much to north korea because i â€śmet.â€ť thatâ€™s because thatâ€™s all they have to disparage! we got so much for peace in the world, & more is being added in finals. even got our hostages/remains!
@realdonaldtrump daniel henninger of the wall street journal: â€śthis ig report makes it clear, as did rod rosensteinâ€™s memo, that trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing jim comey. so i think the mueller investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now.â€ť witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump please clear up the fake news! https://twitter.com/@realdonaldtrump/status/1007745343306584064â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump chuck schumer said â€śthe summit was what the texans call all cattle and no hat.â€ť thank you chuck, but are you sure you got that right? no more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites. hostages already back, hero remains coming home & much more!
@realdonaldtrump comey gave strozk his marching orders. mueller is comeyâ€™s best friend. witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump if president obama (who got nowhere with north korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with north korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that i have, the fake news would have named him a national hero!
@realdonaldtrump it is the democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with boarder security and crime. tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by crime coming from illegal immigration. change the laws!
@realdonaldtrump change the laws!
@realdonaldtrump children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. has anyone been looking at the crime taking place south of the border. it is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. not going to happen in the u.s.
@realdonaldtrump we donâ€™t want what is happening with immigration in europe to happen with us!
@realdonaldtrump the people of germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous berlin coalition. crime in germany is way up. big mistake made all over europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
@realdonaldtrump why donâ€™t the democrats give us the votes to fix the worldâ€™s worst immigration laws? where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including ms-13, coming into our country illegally?
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe highest level of bias iâ€™ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.â€ť trey gowdy on the fbiâ€™s own, peter strzok. also remember that they all worked for slippery james comey and that comey is best friends with robert mueller. a really sick deal, isnâ€™t it?
@realdonaldtrump the democrats should get together with their republican counterparts and work something out on border security & safety. donâ€™t wait until after the election because you are going to lose!
@realdonaldtrump why was the fbiâ€™s sick loser, peter strzok, working on the totally discredited mueller team of 13 angry & conflicted democrats, when strzok was giving crooked hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer lisa page, that â€śweâ€™ll stopâ€ť trump from becoming president? witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump why was the fbi giving so much information to the fake news media. they are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people fake news, they put their own spin on it - truth doesnâ€™t matter to them!
@realdonaldtrump i want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the southern border...it has been going on for many, many decades... pic.twitter.com/1f7ek9ef88

@realdonaldtrump #changethelaws now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security.
@realdonaldtrump we must always arrest people coming into our country illegally. of the 12,000 children, 10,000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip, and only 2000 are with their parents, many of whom have tried to enter our country illegally on numerous occasions.
@realdonaldtrump democrats are the problem. they donâ€™t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our country, like ms-13. they canâ€™t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!
@realdonaldtrump if you donâ€™t have borders, you donâ€™t have a country!
@realdonaldtrump crime in germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. others countries are even worse. be smart america!
@realdonaldtrump i canâ€™t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!â€ť inspector general horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. a rigged witch hunt!p

@realdonaldtrump â€śfbi texts have revealed anti-trump bias.â€ť @foxnews big news, but the fake news doesnâ€™t want to cover. total corruption - the witch hunt has turned out to be a scam! at some point soon the mainstream media will have to cover correctly, too big a story!
@realdonaldtrump itâ€™s the democrats fault, they wonâ€™t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. they want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. republicans want security. but i am working on something - it never ends!
@realdonaldtrump the fake news is not mentioning the safety and security of our country when talking about illegal immigration. our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the dems will do anything not to change them & to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!

@realdonaldtrump homeland security @secnielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country, while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete & nasty laws, which force family separation. we want â€śheartâ€ť and security in america!
@realdonaldtrump you cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including â€śheart,â€ť without getting demonstrative votes. problem is, they donâ€™t care about security and râ€™s do. zero dems voted to support the goodlatte bill. they wonâ€™t vote for anything!
@realdonaldtrump we have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of â€“ and if we show any weakness, millions of people will journey into our country.

@realdonaldtrump henry mcmaster has done a great job as governor of south carolina. the state is booming, with jobs and new industry setting records. he is tough on crime and strong on borders, healthcare, the military and our great vets. henry has my full and complete endrosement! #maga
@realdonaldtrump what is the purpose of the house doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by democrats in the senate, and the dems are only looking to obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the mid-terms). republicans must get rid of the stupid filibuster rule-it is killing you!
@realdonaldtrump last night in minnesota was incredible. what a crowd!
@realdonaldtrump i will be going the columbia, south carolina, on monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters, a man who truly loves the people of south carolina, governor henry mcmaster. henry worked so hard & was so loyal to me that i look forward to reciprocating!
@realdonaldtrump the border has been a big mess and problem for many years. at some point schumer and pelosi, who are weak on crime and border security, will be forced to do a real deal, so easy, that solves this long time problem. schumer used to want border security - now heâ€™ll take crime!
@realdonaldtrump we shouldnâ€™t be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the wall, hire border agents and ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.

@realdonaldtrump we must maintain a strong southern border. we cannot allow our country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!
@realdonaldtrump 80% of mexicoâ€™s exports come to the united states. they totally rely on us, which is fine with me. they do have, though, very strong immigration laws. the u.s. has pathetically weak and ineffective immigration laws that the democrats refuse to help us fix. will speak to mexico!
@realdonaldtrump congresswoman martha roby of alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our make america great again agenda. she is in a republican primary run-off against a recent nancy pelosi voting democrat. i fully endorse martha for alabama second congressional district!
@realdonaldtrump governor henry mcmaster is a truly fine man who loves the people of south carolina. he was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a big south carolina victory. i will see you all in s.c on monday and vice president pence will be there for henry on saturday!
@realdonaldtrump republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen/women in november. dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. we can pass great legislation after the red wave!
@realdonaldtrump elect more republicans in november and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive immigration bills anywhere in the world. right now we have the dumbest and the worst. dems are doing nothing but obstructing. remember their motto, resist! ours is produce!
@realdonaldtrump even if we get 100% republican votes in the senate, we need 10 democrat votes to get a much needed immigration bill - & the dems are obstructionists who wonâ€™t give votes for political reasons & because they donâ€™t care about crime coming from border! so we need to elect more râ€™s!

@realdonaldtrump the united states is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial trade barriers and tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those barriers & tariffs or be met with more than reciprocity by the u.s.a. trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!
@realdonaldtrump ....our immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump we cannot allow all of these people to invade our country. when somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no judges or court cases, bring them back from where they came. our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and law and order. most children come without parents...

@realdonaldtrump hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the u.s. illegally. children brought back to their country......
@realdonaldtrump such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the obama administration and ours. actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under obama. fake news is working overtime!
@realdonaldtrump i have tried to stay uninvolved with the department of justice and fbi (although i do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive witch hunt currently going on. but you do have to ask why the doj & fbi arenâ€™t giving over requested documents?
@realdonaldtrump the red hen restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like sarah huckabee sanders. i always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!

@realdonaldtrump ....we are finishing our study of tariffs on cars from the e.u. in that they have long taken advantage of the u.s. in the form of trade barriers and tariffs. in the end it will all even out - and it wonâ€™t take very long!
@realdonaldtrump ....when i had harley-davidson officials over to the white house, i chided them about tariffs in other countries, like india, being too high. companies are now coming back to america. harley must know that they wonâ€™t be able to sell back into u.s. without paying a big tax!
@realdonaldtrump ....we are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. we are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. they must play fair or they will pay tariffs!
@realdonaldtrump early this year harley-davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in kansas city to thailand. that was long before tariffs were announced. hence, they were just using tariffs/trade war as an excuse. shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it.....

@realdonaldtrump harley-davidson should stay 100% in america, with the people that got you your success. iâ€™ve done so much for you, and then this. other companies are coming back where they belong! we wonâ€™t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very happy competitors!
@realdonaldtrump supreme court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the union deciding for them. big loss for the coffers of the democrats!
@realdonaldtrump house republicans should pass the strong but fair immigration bill, known as goodlatte ii, in their afternoon vote today, even though the dems wonâ€™t let it pass in the senate. passage will show that we want strong borders & security while the dems want open borders = crime. win!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to maxine waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with nancy pelosi, the unhinged face of the democrat party. together, they will make america weak again! but have no fear, america is now stronger than ever before, and iâ€™m not going anywhere!

@realdonaldtrump peter strzok worked as the leader of the rigged witch hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. but remember, he took his orders from comey and mccabe and they took their orders from you know who. mueller/comey best friends!

@realdonaldtrump lover fbi agent peter strzok was given poor marks on yesterdayâ€™s closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. there was no collusion and the witch hunt, headed by 13 angry democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is rigged!

@realdonaldtrump either we need to elect more republicans in november or republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or filibuster, rule - or better yet, do both. cryinâ€™ chuck would do it on day one, but weâ€™ll never give him the chance. some great legislation awaits - be smart!
@realdonaldtrump i never pushed the republicans in the house to vote for the immigration bill, either goodlatte 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. i released many prior to the vote knowing we need more republicans to win in nov.
@realdonaldtrump a friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, sean spicer, has written a great new book, â€śthe briefing: politics, the press and the president.â€ť it is a story told with both heart and knowledge. really good, go get it!

@realdonaldtrump the washington post is constantly quoting â€śanonymous sourcesâ€ť that do not exist. rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. they are a disgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others!

@realdonaldtrump how can the democrats, who are weak on the border and weak on crime, do well in november. the people of our country want and demand safety and security, while the democrats are more interested in ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great law enforcement!
@realdonaldtrump when we have an â€śinfestationâ€ť of ms-13 gangs in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ice! they are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. dems do not appreciate the great job they do! nov.

@realdonaldtrump the rigged witch hunt, originally headed by fbi lover boy peter s (for one year) & now, 13 angry democrats, should look into the missing dnc server, crooked hillaryâ€™s illegally deleted emails, the pakistani fraudster, uranium one, podesta & so much more. itâ€™s a democrat con job!
@realdonaldtrump public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the â€śspecialâ€ť counsel because the public understands that there was no collusion with russia (so ridiculous), that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation & that the only collusion was with the dems!

@realdonaldtrump the united states is spending far more on nato than any other country. this is not fair, nor is it acceptable. while these countries have been increasing their contributions since i took office, they must do much more. germany is at 1%, the u.s. is at 4%, and nato benefits.......
@realdonaldtrump just talked with pfizer Chief Executive Officer and @secazar on our drug pricing blueprint. pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so american patients donâ€™t pay more. we applaud pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. great news for the american people!
@realdonaldtrump the european union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in europe (u.s. has a $151 billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through nato, and nicely pay for it. just doesnâ€™t work!
@realdonaldtrump a recent emerson college epoll said that most americans, especially hispanics, feel that they are better off under president trump than they were under president obama.

@realdonaldtrump what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? the u.s. is paying for europeâ€™s protection, then loses billions on trade. must pay 2% of gdp immediately, not by 2025.

@realdonaldtrump ....on top of it all, germany just started paying russia, the country they want protection from, billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia. not acceptable! all nato nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!
@realdonaldtrump presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia. they pay only a fraction of their cost. the u.s. pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe, and loses big on trade!

@realdonaldtrump the stories you heard about the 12 russians yesterday took place during the obama administration, not the trump administration. why didnâ€™t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september, before the election?

@realdonaldtrump ...know how to do is resist and obstruct! this is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country â€“ but at some point, it will heal!
@realdonaldtrump ...over the years, i would return to criticism that it wasnâ€™t good enough â€“ that i should have gotten saint petersburg in addition! much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the dems...
@realdonaldtrump heading to helsinki, finland â€“ looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow. unfortunately, no matter how well i do at the summit, if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russia...
@realdonaldtrump there hasnâ€™t been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in north korea, there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages. who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isnâ€™t the fake news talking about these wonderful facts? because it is fake news!
@realdonaldtrump will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9pme and @tuckercarlson tomorrow night at 8pme. enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump a productive dialogue is not only good for the united states and good for russia, but it is good for the world. #helsinki2018 pic.twitter.com/q2y1phm9au
@realdonaldtrump i would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace, than to risk peace in pursuit of politics. #helsinki2018 pic.twitter.com/xdlrjwlpih
@realdonaldtrump as i said today and many times before, â€śi have great confidence in my intelligence people.â€ť however, i also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past â€“ as the worldâ€™s two largest nuclear powers, we must get along! #helsinki2018
@realdonaldtrump thank you helsinki, finland! pic.twitter.com/rh4nujpswu
@realdonaldtrump joint press conference from helsinki, finland: https://www.pscp.tv/w/bhy5sdfvtlfstfjub1dwuxd8mujssmplb3ffwujhdyxkixdvfcy7hhzilfyakjbst4y-clf9qi73jdjieiuf?t=1h19m53sâ â€¦
@realdonaldtrump it was an honor to join you this morning. thank you! https://twitter.com/tpkanslia/status/1018758475055321088â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of u.s. foolishness and stupidity and now, the rigged witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump president obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling, he said it couldnâ€™t happen, was no big deal, & did nothing about it. when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzok!
@realdonaldtrump received many calls from leaders of nato countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present & future. we had a truly great summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. nato is now strong & rich!
@realdonaldtrump the economy of the united states is stronger than ever before!
@realdonaldtrump thank you @randpaul. â€śthe president has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - whatâ€™s he supposed to think?â€ť
@realdonaldtrump while i had a great meeting with nato, raising vast amounts of money, i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia. sadly, it is not being reported that way - the fake news is going crazy!
@realdonaldtrump i had a great meeting with nato. they have paid $33 billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future, only because of me. nato was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for russia). the media only says i was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!
@realdonaldtrump the two biggest opponents of ice in america today are the democratic party and ms-13!
@realdonaldtrump thank you to congressman kevin yoder! he secured $5 billion for border security. now we need congress to support. kevin has been strong on crime, the border, the second amendment, and he loves our military and vets. @repkevinyoder has my full and total endorsement!
@realdonaldtrump brian kemp is running for governor of the great state of georgia. the primary is on tuesday. brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration. he loves our military and our vets and protects our second amendment. i give him my full and total endorsement.
@realdonaldtrump 3.4 million jobs created since our great election victory - far greater than ever anticipated, and only getting better as new and greatly improved trade deals start coming to fruition!
@realdonaldtrump some people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia. they would rather go to war than see this. itâ€™s called trump derangement syndrome!
@realdonaldtrump â€śa lot of democrats wished they voted for the tax cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again.â€ť @foxandfriends @kilmeade
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to martha roby of the great state of alabama on her big gop primary win for congress. my endorsement came appropriately late, but when it came the â€śflood gatesâ€ť opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve. enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump ....russia has agreed to help with north korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. there is no rush, the sanctions remain! big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of process!
@realdonaldtrump while the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success. many positive things will come out of that meeting..
@realdonaldtrump so many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in helsinki. putin and i discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. we got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. big results will come!
@realdonaldtrump â€śprosperity is returning. donald trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate, now as the most effective president, the most successful president, in modern american history.â€ť thank you to the great lou dobbs!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats want to abolish ice, which will mean more crime in our country. i want to give ice a big cheer! vote republican in november.
@realdonaldtrump the meeting between president putin and myself was a great success, except in the fake news media!
@realdonaldtrump will the dems and fake news ever learn? this is classic! pic.twitter.com/ksx3roi4qg
@realdonaldtrump â€śtrump recognized russian meddling many timesâ€ť pic.twitter.com/t8mers93wi
@realdonaldtrump ....proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, ukraine, middle east peace, north korea and more. there are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems...but they can all be solved!
@realdonaldtrump the summit with russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the fake news media. i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for israel, nuclear........
@realdonaldtrump i told you so! the european union just slapped a five billion dollar fine on one of our great companies, google. they truly have taken advantage of the u.s., but not for long!
@realdonaldtrump really big jobs meeting today at the white house! 3 p.m.
@realdonaldtrump â€śtrump recognized russian meddling many times.â€ť thank you to @foxandfriends and @foxnews for actually showing the clips. the fake news wants no part of that narrative! too bad they donâ€™t want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set.
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that iâ€™ll probably have a good relationship with putin. we are doing much better than any other country!
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media is going crazy! they make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. but iâ€™ll complain anyway!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ice. this should cost them heavily in the midterms. yesterday, the republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ice!
@realdonaldtrump thank you to novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. likewise to pfizer. we are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs.
@realdonaldtrump a total disgrace that turkey will not release a respected u.s. pastor, andrew brunson, from prison. he has been held hostage far too long. @rt_erdogan should do something to free this wonderful christian husband & father. he has done nothing wrong, and his family needs him!
@realdonaldtrump the nfl national anthem debate is alive and well again - canâ€™t believe it! isnâ€™t it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? the $40,000,000 commissioner must now make a stand. first time kneeling, out for game. second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!
@realdonaldtrump i got severely criticized by the fake news media for being too nice to president putin. in the old days they would call it diplomacy. if i was loud & vicious, i would have been criticized for being too tough. remember when they said i was too tough with chairman kim? hypocrites!
@realdonaldtrump so important. should have been done years ago! https://twitter.com/scavino45/status/1020144866012073991â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. the price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the election. a big reason is bad (terrible) trade deals with other countries. they put on massive tariffs and barriers. canada charges 275% on dairy. farmers will win!
@realdonaldtrump ....the united states should not be penalized because we are doing so well. tightening now hurts all that we have done. the u.s. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and bad trade deals. debt coming due & we are raising rates - really?
@realdonaldtrump china, the european union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the u.s. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. as usual, not a level playing field...
@realdonaldtrump my deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in missouri. such a tragedy, such a great loss. may god be with you all!
@realdonaldtrump troy balderson of ohio is running for congress against a nancy pelosi liberal who is weak on crime & borders. troy is the total opposite, and loves our military, vets & second amendment. early voting just started with election day on august 7th. troy has my full & total endorsement!
@realdonaldtrump brian kemp, who is running for governor of georgia and has my full endorsement, is campaigning tonight with vp @mike_pence. brian is very strong on crime and borders, loves our military, vets and the second amendment. he will be a great governor!
@realdonaldtrump no collusion, no obstruction - but that doesnâ€™t matter because the 13 angry democrats, who are only after republicans and totally protecting democrats, want this witch hunt to drag out to the november election. republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!
@realdonaldtrump the rigged witch hunt, headed by the 13 angry democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for obama w.h.), seems intent on damaging the republican partyâ€™s chances in the november election. this democrat excuse for losing the â€16 election never ends!
@realdonaldtrump inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyerâ€™s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. the good news is that your favorite president did nothing wrong!
@realdonaldtrump so president obama knew about russia before the election. why didnâ€™t he do something about it? why didnâ€™t he tell our campaign? because it is all a big hoax, thatâ€™s why, and he thought crooked hillary was going to win!!!
@realdonaldtrump happy birthday @senatordole! https://twitter.com/senatordole/status/1021104267564847104â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. so bad for our country!
@realdonaldtrump .@petehegseth on @foxnews â€śsource #1 was the (fake) dossier. yes, the dirty dossier, paid for by democrats as a hit piece against trump, and looking for information that could discredit candidate #1 trump. carter page was just the foot to surveil the trump campaign...â€ť illegal!
@realdonaldtrump andrew mccarthy - â€śi said this could never happen. this is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. it is so bad it screams out at you.â€ť on the whole fisa scam which led to the rigged mueller witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump looking more & more like the trump campaign for president was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc. ask her how that worked out - she did better with crazy bernie. republicans must get tough now. an illegal scam!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to @judicialwatch and @tomfitton on being successful in getting the carter page fisa documents. as usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the department of â€śjusticeâ€ť and fbi misled the courts. witch hunt rigged, a scam!
@realdonaldtrump ....in my opinion the washington post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for amazon. is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?
@realdonaldtrump the amazon washington post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the internet tax case in the u.s. supreme court two months ago. next up is the u.s. post office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their â€śdelivery boyâ€ť for a big percentage of their packages....
@realdonaldtrump a rocket has not been launched by north korea in 9 months. likewise, no nuclear tests. japan is happy, all of asia is happy. but the fake news is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that i am angry because it is not going fast enough. wrong, very happy!
@realdonaldtrump when you hear the fake news talking negatively about my meeting with president putin, and all that i gave up, remember, i gave up nothing, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the corrupt media!
@realdonaldtrump .....â€ťcarter page wasnâ€™t a spy, wasnâ€™t an agent of the russians - he would have cooperated with the fbi. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump.â€ť tom fitton @judicialwatch a disgrace to america. they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now!
@realdonaldtrump ....and the doj, fbi and obama gang need to be held to account. source #1 was the major source. avoided talking about it being the clinton campaign behind it. misled the court to provide a pretext to spy on the trump team. not about carter page..was all about getting trump.....
@realdonaldtrump â€śit was classified to cover up misconduct by the fbi and the justice department in misleading the court by using this dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the trump team. this is a clinton campaign document. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump....
@realdonaldtrump so we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and fake dirty dossier, that was paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the dnc, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to fisa and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited mueller witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump tom fitton on @foxandfriends at 6:15 a.m. now! judicial watch.
@realdonaldtrump to iranian president rouhani: never, ever threaten the united states again or you will suffer consequences the likes of which few throughout history have ever suffered before. we are no longer a country that will stand for your demented words of violence & death. be cautious!

@realdonaldtrump on the heels of the very successful launch of the @whitehouse national council for the american worker, congress should reauthorize #perkinscte and ensure the american workforce remains stronger than ever! #jobs #workforce

@realdonaldtrump iâ€™m very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election. based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the democrats. they definitely donâ€™t want trump!
@realdonaldtrump make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump heading to missouri to be with many of my great friends. vfw here we come!
@realdonaldtrump our country is doing great. best financial numbers on the planet. great to have usa winning again!
@realdonaldtrump today is the day to vote for brian kemp. will be great for georgia, full endorsement! https://twitter.com/@realdonaldtrump/status/1020808378594054144â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump tariffs are the greatest! either a country which has treated the united states unfairly on trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with tariffs. itâ€™s as simple as that - and everybodyâ€™s talking! remember, we are the â€śpiggy bankâ€ť thatâ€™s being robbed. all will be great!
@realdonaldtrump "countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to washington to negotiate. this should have taken place many years ago but, as the saying goes, better late than never!"

@realdonaldtrump great meeting on trade today with @junckereu and representatives of the european union. we have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs, no barriers and no subsidies. work on documents has already started and the process is moving...

@realdonaldtrump this week, my administration is hosting the first-ever #irfministerial. the u.s. will continue to promote #religiousfreedom around the world. nations that support religious freedom are far more free, prosperous & peaceful. great job, @vp, @secpompeo, @irf_ambassador & @statedept!

@realdonaldtrump congratulations to brian kemp on your very big win in georgia last night. wow, 69-30, those are big numbers. now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the democrats have given you. she is weak on vets, the military and the second amendment. win!
@realdonaldtrump what kind of a lawyer would tape a client? so sad! is this a first, never heard of it before? why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while i was presumably saying positive things? i hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? too bad!
@realdonaldtrump china is targeting our farmers, who they know i love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the u.s. they are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. we were being nice - until now! china made $517 billion on us last year.
@realdonaldtrump when you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. negotiations are going really well, be cool. the end result will be worth it!
@realdonaldtrump every time i see a weak politician asking to stop trade talks or the use of tariffs to counter unfair tariffs, i wonder, what can they be thinking? are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? lost $817 billion on trade last year. no weakness!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe russia hoax, the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton & frame donald trumpâ€ť is a hot seller, already number one! more importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about. it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly. congratulations to gregg jarrett!
@realdonaldtrump so sad and unfair that the fcc wouldnâ€™t approve the sinclair broadcast merger with tribune. this would have been a great and much needed conservative voice for and of the people. liberal fake news nbc and comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not sinclair. disgraceful!
@realdonaldtrump the european union is coming to washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on trade. i have an idea for them. both the u.s. and the e.u. drop all tariffs, barriers and subsidies! that would finally be called free market and fair trade! hope they do it, we are ready - but they wonâ€™t!
@realdonaldtrump ...called â€śthe case against impeaching trump,â€ť which i would encourage all people with trump derangement syndrome to read!

@realdonaldtrump thank you georgia! they say that my endorsement last week of brian kemp, in the republican primary for governor against a very worthy opponent, lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory! two very good and talented men in a great race, but congratulations to brian!

@realdonaldtrump ....,the only collusion with russia was with the democrats, so now they are looking at my tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged witch hunt continues! how stupid and unfair to our country....and so the fake news doesnâ€™t waste my time with dumb questions, no,....

@realdonaldtrump the only things the democrats do well is â€śresist,â€ť which is their campaign slogan, and â€śobstruct.â€ť cryinâ€™ chuck schumer has almost 400 great american people that are waiting â€śforeverâ€ť to serve our country! a total disgrace. mitch m should not let them go home until all approved!
@realdonaldtrump ....also, why is mueller only appointing angry dems, some of whom have worked for crooked hillary, others, including himself, have worked for obama....and why isnâ€™t mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real russian collusion on the democrats side-podesta, dossier?
@realdonaldtrump is robert mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to president trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship, i turned him down to head the fbi (one day before appointment as s.c.) & comey is his close friend..
@realdonaldtrump there is no collusion! the robert mueller rigged witch hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an obama white house lawyer) angry democrats, was started by a fraudulent dossier, paid for by crooked hillary and the dnc. therefore, the witch hunt is an illegal scam!
@realdonaldtrump ...and the amazon washington post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change!
@realdonaldtrump ...dying newspaper industry. no matter how much they try to distract and cover it up, our country is making great progress under my leadership and i will never stop fighting for the american people! as an example, the failing new york times...
@realdonaldtrump ...accurately. 90% of media coverage of my administration is negative, despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving, itâ€™s no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low! i will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-trump haters in the...
@realdonaldtrump when the media - driven insane by their trump derangement syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk! very unpatriotic! freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news...
@realdonaldtrump i would be willing to â€śshut downâ€ť government if the democrats do not give us the votes for border security, which includes the wall! must get rid of lottery, catch & release etcetera. and finally go to system of immigration based on merit! we need great people coming into our country!

@realdonaldtrump russian collusion with the trump campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a total hoax. the democrats paid for the phony and discredited dossier which was, along with comey, mccabe, strzok and his lover, the lovely lisa page, used to begin the witch hunt. disgraceful!
@realdonaldtrump paul manafort worked for ronald reagan, bob dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. he worked for me for a very short time. why didnâ€™t government tell me that he was under investigation. these old charges have nothing to do with collusion - a hoax!
@realdonaldtrump ..this is a terrible situation and attorney general jeff sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. bob mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 angry democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to usa!

@realdonaldtrump ....tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. only fools would disagree. we are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and, if countries are still unwilling to negotiate, they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of tariffs. we win either way......
@realdonaldtrump ....tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our steel industry. plants are opening all over the u.s., steelworkers are working again, and big dollars are flowing into our treasury. other countries use tariffs against, but when we use them, foolish people scream!

@realdonaldtrump tariffs are working big time. every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the u.s., always to our detriment. i say, as they come,tax them. if they donâ€™t want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the u.s. in either event, it means jobs and great wealth.....
@realdonaldtrump the fake news hates me saying that they are the enemy of the people only because they know itâ€™s true. i am providing a great service by explaining this to the american people. they purposely cause great division & distrust. they can also cause war! they are very dangerous & sick!

@realdonaldtrump nbc fake news, which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the harvey weinstein story, is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct. i have long criticized nbc and their journalistic standards-worse than even cnn. look at their license?
@realdonaldtrump does the so-called â€śsenior administration officialâ€ť really exist, or is it just the failing new york times with another phony source? if the gutless anonymous person does indeed exist, the times must, for national security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!

@realdonaldtrump just like the nfl, whose ratings have gone way down, nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. i wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? as far as the nfl is concerned, i just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the flag!

@realdonaldtrump isnâ€™t it a shame that someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost. donâ€™t know why washington politicians donâ€™t change libel laws?

@realdonaldtrump if the democrats had won the election in 2016, gdp, which was about 1% and going down, would have been minus 4% instead of up 4.2%. i opened up our beautiful economic engine with regulation and tax cuts. our system was choking and would have been made worse. still plenty to do!

@realdonaldtrump .....this was done by the democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when i was successfully raising billions of dollars to help rebuild puerto rico. if a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. bad politics. i love puerto rico!
@realdonaldtrump 3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit puerto rico. when i left the island, after the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. as time went by it did not go up by much. then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000...

@realdonaldtrump so if african-american unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things i have done, how do democrats, who have done nothing for african-americans but talk, win the black vote? and it will only get better!

@realdonaldtrump the new york times has a new fake story that now the russians and chinese (glad they finally added china) are listening to all of my calls on cellphones. except that i rarely use a cellphone, & when i do itâ€™s government authorized. i like hard lines. just more made up fake news!
@realdonaldtrump a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that i refer to as fake news. it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description. mainstream media must clean up its act, fast!
@realdonaldtrump brandon judd of the national border patrol council is right when he says on @foxandfriends that the democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the border. must be chanded, but i am bringing out the military for this national emergency. they will be stopped!
@realdonaldtrump the so-called experts on trump over at the new york times wrote a long and boring article on my cellphone usage that is so incorrect i do not have time here to correct it. i only use government phones, and have only one seldom used government cell phone. story is soooo wrong!

@realdonaldtrump republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this â€śbombâ€ť stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics. very unfortunate, what is going on. republicans, go out and vote!
@realdonaldtrump twitter has removed many people from my account and, more importantly, they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all. a few weeks ago it was a rocket ship, now it is a blimp! total bias?
@realdonaldtrump the united states has been spending billions of dollars a year on illegal immigration. this will not continue. democrats must give us the votes to pass strong (but fair) laws. if not, we will be forced to play a much tougher hand.
@realdonaldtrump funny how lowly rated cnn, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of bombs and ridiculously comparing this to september 11th and the oklahoma city bombing, yet when i criticize them they go wild and scream, â€śitâ€™s just not presidential!â€ť
@realdonaldtrump ...this evil anti-semitic attack is an assault on humanity. it will take all of us working together to extract the poison of anti-semitism from our world. we must unite to conquer hate.

@realdonaldtrump in florida there is a choice between a harvard/yale educated man named @rondesantisfl who has been a great congressman and will be a great governor - and a demonstrative who is a thief and who is mayor of poorly run tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the country!
@realdonaldtrump many gang members and some very bad people are mixed into the caravan heading to our southern border. please go back, you will not be admitted into the united states unless you go through the legal process. this is an invasion of our country and our military is waiting for you!

@realdonaldtrump there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. the fake news media, the true enemy of the people, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly. that will do much to put out the flame...

@realdonaldtrump cnn and others in the fake news business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that i said the â€śmedia is the enemy of the people.â€ť wrong! i said that the â€śfake news (media) is the enemy of the people,â€ť a very big difference. when you give out false information - not good!

@realdonaldtrump â€śdonald trump has made good on his promises, and it drives democrats crazy!â€ť brad blakeman @foxnews

@realdonaldtrump ....harry reid was right in 1993, before he and the democrats went insane and started with the open borders (which brings massive crime) â€śstuff.â€ť donâ€™t forget the nasty term anchor babies. i will keep our country safe. this case will be settled by the united states supreme court!
@realdonaldtrump so-called birthright citizenship, which costs our country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other. it is not covered by the 14th amendment because of the words â€śsubject to the jurisdiction thereof.â€ť many legal scholars agree.....
@realdonaldtrump melania and i were treated very nicely yesterday in pittsburgh. the office of the president was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. we were treated so warmly. small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. the fake news stories were just the opposite-disgraceful! pic.twitter.com/9b9hgcf1g9

@realdonaldtrump republicans have created the best economy in the history of our country â€“ and the hottest jobs market on planet earth. the democrat agenda is a socialist nightmare. the republican agenda is the american dream! http://vote.gopâ pic.twitter.com/jfdm1p5xxy
@realdonaldtrump thank you ohio! when you enter the voting booth tomorrow you will be making a simple choice. a vote for republicans is a vote to continue our extraordinary prosperity. a vote for dems is a vote to bring this economic boom crashing to a sudden, screeching halt. vote @mikedewine! pic.twitter.com/iai8bsegbh
@realdonaldtrump â€śbill nelson is kind of an empty figure in washington. you never hear his name, heâ€™s never in debates on key issues - he is just under the radar.â€ť chris wallace on @foxnews in other words, nelson is a â€śstiff.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump law enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any illegal voting which may take place in tuesdayâ€™s election (or early voting). anyone caught will be subject to the maximum criminal penalties allowed by law. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump remember florida: i have been president of the united states for almost two years. during that time senator bill nelson didnâ€™t call me once. rick scott called constantly requesting dollars plus for florida. did a great job on hurricanes. vote scott!
@realdonaldtrump so funny to see the cnn fake suppression polls and false rhetoric. watch for real results tuesday. we are lucky cnnâ€™s ratings are so low. donâ€™t fall for the suppression game. go out & vote. remember, we now have perhaps the greatest economy (jobs) in the history of our country!
@realdonaldtrump i need @claudiatenney of #ny22 to be re-elected in order to get our big plans moving. her opponent would be a disaster. nobody works harder than claudia, and she is a producer. i look forward to working together with her - she has my strongest endorsement! vote claudia!
@realdonaldtrump no matter what she says, senator claire mccaskill will always vote against us and the great state of missouri! vote for joshua hawley - he will be a great senator!
@realdonaldtrump if @andrewgillum did the same job with florida that he has done in tallahassee as mayor, the state will be a crime ridden, overtaxed mess. @rondesantisfl will be a great governor. vote!!!!!!
@realdonaldtrump .@debbiestabenow voted against tax cuts, great healthcare, supreme court justices and all of the many things the people of michigan wanted and need. she is an automatic far left vote, controlled by her bosses. john james can be a truly great senator!
@realdonaldtrump dana rohrabacher has been a great congressman for his district and for the people of cal. he works hard and is respected by all - he produces! dems are desperate to replace dana by spending vast sums to elect a super liberal who is weak on crime and bad for our military & vets!
@realdonaldtrump john james, running as a republican for the senate from michigan, is a spectacular young star of the future. we should make him a star of the present. a distinguished west point grad and vet, people should vote out schumer puppet debbie stabenow, who does nothing for michigan!
@realdonaldtrump in just 2 days, the people of tennessee are going to elect @votemarsha blackburn to the united states senate to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and continue making america great again! get out on tuesday and vote for marsha! pic.twitter.com/bjhmitntmo

@realdonaldtrump there is a rumor, put out by the democrats, that joshua hawley of missouri left the arena last night early. it is fake news. he met me at the plane when i arrived, spoke at the great rally, & stayed to the very end. in fact, i said goodbye to him and left before he did. deception!
@realdonaldtrump a fantastic evening in cape girardeau, missouri. joshua @hawleymo will be a tireless champion for you. he is great on jobs, great on tax cuts, and tough on crime. he shares your values, and he will always support our military, vets and police! get out tomorrow and vote for josh!! pic.twitter.com/ypb8nqx2d6
@realdonaldtrump a vote for claire mccaskill is a vote for schumer, pelosi, waters, and their socialist agenda. claire voted in favor of deadly sanctuary cities - she would rather protect criminal aliens than american citizens, which is why she needs to be voted out of office. vote @hawleymo! pic.twitter.com/tn2zsewqj5

@realdonaldtrump ....we thank attorney general jeff sessions for his service, and wish him well! a permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.
@realdonaldtrump we are pleased to announce that matthew g. whitaker, chief of staff to attorney general jeff sessions at the department of justice, will become our new acting attorney general of the united states. he will serve our country well....
@realdonaldtrump according to nbc news, voters nationwide disapprove of the so-called mueller investigation (46%) more than they approve (41%). you mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting witch hunt, led by 17 angry democrats, is all about!
@realdonaldtrump in all fairness, nancy pelosi deserves to be chosen speaker of the house by the democrats. if they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some republican votes. she has earned this great honor!
@realdonaldtrump if the democrats think they are going to waste taxpayer money investigating us at the house level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of classified information, and much else, at the senate level. two can play that game!
@realdonaldtrump to any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great midterm election, just remember two words - fake news!
@realdonaldtrump i will be doing a news conference at the white house - 11:30 a.m. will be discussing our success in the midterms!
@realdonaldtrump those that worked with me in this incredible midterm election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. those that did not, say goodbye! yesterday was such a very big win, and all under the pressure of a nasty and hostile media!
@realdonaldtrump ron desantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the governor of florida. congratulations to ron and family!
@realdonaldtrump received so many congratulations from so many on our big victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on trade deals. now we can all get back to work and get things done!
@realdonaldtrump .@davidasmanfox â€śhow do the democrats respond to this? think of how his position with republicans improves-all the candidates who won tonight. they realize how important he is because of what he did in campaigning for them. they owe him their political career.â€ť thanks, i agree!
@realdonaldtrump ....unbelievably lucky to have him and iâ€™m just awed at how well theyâ€™ve done. itâ€™s all the trump magic - trump is the magic man. incredible, heâ€™s got the entire media against him, attacking him every day, and he pulls out these enormous wins.â€ť ben stein, â€śthe capitalist codeâ€ť
@realdonaldtrump â€śthereâ€™s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent president has won seats in the senate in the off year election. mr. trump has magic about him. this guy has magic coming out of his ears. he is an astonishing vote getter & campaigner. the republicans are.........
@realdonaldtrump tremendous success tonight. thank you to all!
@realdonaldtrump ....great bravery shown by police. california highway patrol was on scene within 3 minutes, with first officer to enter shot numerous times. that sheriffâ€™s sergeant died in the hospital. god bless all of the victims and families of the victims. thank you to law enforcement.
@realdonaldtrump i have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in california. law enforcement and first responders, together with the fbi, are on scene. 13 people, at this time, have been reported dead. likewise, the shooter is dead, along with the first police officer to enter the bar....
@realdonaldtrump president macron of france has just suggested that europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the u.s., china and russia. very insulting, but perhaps europe should first pay its fair share of nato, which the u.s. subsidizes greatly!
@realdonaldtrump just out â€” in arizona, signatures donâ€™t match. electoral corruption - call for a new election? we must protect our democracy!
@realdonaldtrump thank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to election theft in broward and palm beach counties. the world is now watching closely!
@realdonaldtrump in the 2016 election i was winning by so much in florida that broward county, which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a â€śnumber,â€ť couldnâ€™t do it because not enough people live in broward for them to falsify a victory!
@realdonaldtrump mayor gillum conceded on election day and now broward county has put him â€śback into play.â€ť bill nelson conceded election - now heâ€™s back in play!? this is an embarrassment to our country and to democracy!
@realdonaldtrump rick scott was up by 50,000+ votes on election day, now they â€śfoundâ€ť many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. â€śthe broward effect.â€ť how come they never find republican votes?
@realdonaldtrump jeff flake(y) doesnâ€™t want to protect the non-senate confirmed special counsel, he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in arizona for the â€ścrimeâ€ť of doing a terrible job! a weak and ineffective guy!
@realdonaldtrump as soon as democrats sent their best election stealing lawyer, marc elias, to broward county they miraculously started finding democrat votes. donâ€™t worry, florida - i am sending much better lawyers to expose the fraud!
@realdonaldtrump you mean they are just now finding votes in florida and georgia â€“ but the election was on tuesday? letâ€™s blame the russians and demand an immediate apology from president putin!

@realdonaldtrump these california fires are expanding very, very quickly (in some cases 80-100 acres a minute). if people donâ€™t evacuate quickly, they risk being overtaken by the fire. please listen to evacuation orders from state and local officials!
@realdonaldtrump more than 4,000 are fighting the camp and woolsey fires in california that have burned over 170,000 acres. our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. the destruction is catastrophic. god bless them all.

@realdonaldtrump there is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in california except that forest management is so poor. billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. remedy now, or no more fed payments!
@realdonaldtrump ....mr. whitaker is very highly thought of by @senjoniernst, senator @chuckgrassley, ambassador @terrybranstad, leonard leo of federalist society, and many more. i feel certain he will make an outstanding acting attorney general!
@realdonaldtrump matthew g. whitaker is a highly respected former u.s. attorney from iowa. he was chosen by jeff sessions to be his chief of staff. i did not know mr. whitaker. likewise, as chief, i did not know mr. whitaker except primarily as he traveled with a.g. sessions. no social contact...

@realdonaldtrump the prospect of presidential harassment by the dems is causing the stock market big headaches!
@realdonaldtrump the florida election should be called in favor of rick scott and ron desantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. an honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. must go with election night!
@realdonaldtrump .....of money spent on protecting other countries, and we get nothing but trade deficits and losses. it is time that these very rich countries either pay the united states for its great military protection, or protect themselves...and trade must be made free and fair!
@realdonaldtrump .....hundreds of billions of dollars, for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade. i told them that this situation cannot continue - it is, and always has been, ridiculously unfair to the united states. massive amounts.....
@realdonaldtrump just returned from france where much was accomplished in my meetings with world leaders. never easy bringing up the fact that the u.s. must be treated fairly, which it hasnâ€™t, on both military and trade. we pay for large portions of other countries military protection,........

@realdonaldtrump when will bill nelson concede in florida? the characters running broward and palm beach voting will not be able to â€śfindâ€ť enough votes, too much spotlight on them now!
@realdonaldtrump by the way, when the helicopter couldnâ€™t fly to the first cemetery in france because of almost zero visibility, i suggested driving. secret service said no, too far from airport & big paris shutdown. speech next day at american cemetery in pouring rain! little reported-fake news!
@realdonaldtrump ......make france great again!
@realdonaldtrump the problem is that emmanuel suffers from a very low approval rating in france, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. he was just trying to get onto another subject. by the way, there is no country more nationalist than france, very proud people-and rightfully so!........
@realdonaldtrump on trade, france makes excellent wine, but so does the u.s. the problem is that france makes it very hard for the u.s. to sell its wines into france, and charges big tariffs, whereas the u.s. makes it easy for french wines, and charges very small tariffs. not fair, must change!
@realdonaldtrump emmanuel macron suggests building its own army to protect europe against the u.s., china and russia. but it was germany in world wars one & two - how did that work out for france? they were starting to learn german in paris before the u.s. came along. pay for nato or not!

@realdonaldtrump the only â€ścollusionâ€ť is that of the democrats with russia and many others. why didnâ€™t the fbi take the server from the dnc? they still donâ€™t have it. check out how biased facebook, google and twitter are in favor of the democrats. thatâ€™s the real collusion!
@realdonaldtrump universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and not senate approved) bob mueller and his gang of democrat thugs have done to destroy people. why is he protecting crooked hillary, comey, mccabe, lisa page & her lover, peter s, and all of his friends on the other side?
@realdonaldtrump ....care how many lives the ruin. these are angry people, including the highly conflicted bob mueller, who worked for obama for 8 years. they wonâ€™t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. a total witch hunt like no other in american history!
@realdonaldtrump the inner workings of the mueller investigation are a total mess. they have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. they are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. they are a disgrace to our nation and donâ€™t...
@realdonaldtrump the white house is running very smoothly and the results for our nation are obviously very good. we are the envy of the world. but anytime i even think about making changes, the fake news media goes crazy, always seeking to make us look as bad as possible! very dishonest!

@realdonaldtrump congratulations to ron desantis on becoming the new governor of florida. against all odds, he fought & fought & fought, the result being a historic victory. he never gave up and never will. he will be a great governor!
@realdonaldtrump from day one rick scott never wavered. he was a great governor and will be even a greater senator in representing the people of florida. congratulations to rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!
@realdonaldtrump catch and release is an obsolete term. it is now catch and detain. illegal immigrants trying to come into the u.s.a., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for u.s. asylum, will be detained or turned away. dems must approve border security & wall now!
@realdonaldtrump the mayor of tijuana, mexico, just stated that â€śthe city is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months.â€ť likewise, the u.s. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. they are causing crime and big problems in mexico. go home!

@realdonaldtrump of course we should have captured osama bin laden long before we did. i pointed him out in my book just before the attack on the world trade center. president clinton famously missed his shot. we paid pakistan billions of dollars & they never told us he was living there. fools!..

@realdonaldtrump i hope the discovery and eventual recovery of the argentine submarine san juan brings needed closure to the wonderful families of those brave missing sailors. i look forward to hearing more from my friend president @mauriciomacri in argentina later this month.
@realdonaldtrump â€ś79% of these decisions have been overturned in the nineth circuit.â€ť @foxnews a terrible, costly and dangerous disgrace. it has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays. much talk over dividing up the nineth circuit into 2 or 3 circuits. too big!
@realdonaldtrump there are a lot of criminals in the caravan. we will stop them. catch and detain! judicial activism, by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens, is putting our country in great danger. not good!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthank you to president trump on the border. no american president has ever done this before.â€ť hector garza, national border patrol council
@realdonaldtrump .....are so many opposing view (on border and safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned. please study the numbers, they are shocking. we need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe! very dangerous and unwise!
@realdonaldtrump sorry chief justice john roberts, but you do indeed have â€śobama judges,â€ť and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country. it would be great if the nineth circuit was indeed an â€śindependent judiciary,â€ť but if it is why......
@realdonaldtrump great new book out, â€śmad politics: keeping your sanity in a world gone crazyâ€ť by @realdrgina loudon. go out and get your copy today â€” a great read!
@realdonaldtrump "â€śâ€trump imitation syndromeâ€™ is afflicting the presidentâ€™s liberal enemiesâ€ť thank you @mgoodwin_nypost! https://nypost.com/2018/11/20/trump-imitation-syndrome-is-afflicting-the-presidents-liberal-enemiesâ â€¦"
@realdonaldtrump make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump oil prices getting lower. great! like a big tax cut for america and the world. enjoy! $54, was just $82. thank you to saudi arabia, but letâ€™s go lower!
@realdonaldtrump america first!
@realdonaldtrump so-called comedian michelle wolf bombed so badly last year at the white house correspondentsâ€™ dinner that this year, for the first time in decades, they will have an author instead of a comedian. good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition! maybe i will go?
@realdonaldtrump our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the border because of the judicial activism and interference by the nineth circuit. nevertheless, they are working hard to make america a safer place, though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins!
@realdonaldtrump this is the coldest weather in the history of the thanksgiving day parade in nyc, and one of the coldest thanksgivings on record!
@realdonaldtrump will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world, through teleconference, at 9:00 a.m. eastern. then it will be off to see our coast guard patriots & to thank them for the great job they have been doing, especially with the hurricanes. happy thanksgiving!
@realdonaldtrump ....and safety at the border, or anywhere else. they know nothing about it and are making our country unsafe. our great law enforcement professionals must be allowed to do their job! if not there will be only bedlam, chaos, injury and death. we want the constitution as written!
@realdonaldtrump justice roberts can say what he wants, but the nineth circuit is a complete & total disaster. it is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any circuit in the country, 79%, & is used to get an almost guaranteed result. judges must not legislate security...
@realdonaldtrump happy thanksgiving to all!
@realdonaldtrump â€śitâ€™s a mean & nasty world out there, the middle east in particular. this is a long and historic commitment, & one that is absolutely vital to americaâ€™s national security.â€ť @secpompeo i agree 100%. in addition, many billions of dollars of purchases made in u.s., big jobs & oil!
@realdonaldtrump you just canâ€™t win with the fake news media. a big story today is that because i have pushed so hard and gotten gasoline prices so low, more people are driving and i have caused traffic jams throughout our great nation. sorry everyone!
@realdonaldtrump brutal and extended cold blast could shatter all records - whatever happened to global warming?
@realdonaldtrump i am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by @ustreasury secretary @stevenmnuchin1. the fake news likes to write stories to the contrary, quoting phony sources or jealous people, but they arenâ€™t true. they never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story.
@realdonaldtrump really good criminal justice reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support. @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell and @senschumer have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country. already passed, with big vote, in house. would be a major victory for all!
@realdonaldtrump republicans and democrats must come together, finally, with a major border security package, which will include funding for the wall. after 40 years of talk, it is finally time for action. fix the border, for once and for all, now!
@realdonaldtrump ....all will stay in mexico. if for any reason it becomes necessary, we will close our southern border. there is no way that the united states will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore!
@realdonaldtrump migrants at the southern border will not be allowed into the united states until their claims are individually approved in court. we only will allow those who come into our country legally. other than that our very strong policy is catch and detain. no â€śreleasingâ€ť into the u.s...
@realdonaldtrump clinton foundation donations drop 42% - which shows that they illegally played the power game. they monetized their political influence through the foundation. â€śduring her tenure the state department was put in the service of the clinton foundation.â€ť andrew mccarthy
@realdonaldtrump europe has to pay their fair share for military protection. the european union, for many years, has taken advantage of us on trade, and then they donâ€™t live up to their military commitment through nato. things must change fast!
@realdonaldtrump general anthony tata: â€śpresident trump is a man of his word & he said he was going to be tough on the border, and he is tough on the border. he has rightfully strengthened the border in the face of an unprecedented threat. itâ€™s the right move by president trump.â€ť thanks general!
@realdonaldtrump mississippi, vote for @cindyhydesmith on tuesday. respected by all. we need her in washington!. thanks!
@realdonaldtrump so great that oil prices are falling (thank you president t). add that, which is like a big tax cut, to our other good economic news. inflation down (are you listening fed)!
@realdonaldtrump would be very smart if mexico would stop the caravans long before they get to our southern border, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in u.s. no longer). dems created this problem. no crossings!
@realdonaldtrump the large and violent french protests donâ€™t take into account how badly the united states has been treated on trade by the european union or on fair and reasonable payments for our great military protection. both of these topics must be remedied soon.
@realdonaldtrump i will be in gulfport and tupelo, mississippi, on monday night doing two rallies for senator hyde-smith, who has a very important election on tuesday. she is an outstanding person who is strong on the border, crime, military, our great vets, healthcare & the second a. needed in d.c.
@realdonaldtrump victor davis hanson was a very good and interesting guest of mark levin on @foxnews. he wrote a highly touted book called â€śthe second world warsâ€ť and a new book will soon be coming out called â€śthe case for trump.â€ť recommend both. @marklevinshow
@realdonaldtrump ....starts today, election is on december 4th. @votebradraff is tough on crime and borders, loves our military and vets. he will be great for jobs!
@realdonaldtrump brad raffensperger will be a fantastic secretary of state for georgia - will work closely with @briankempga. it is really important that you get out and vote for brad - early voting....

@realdonaldtrump on the ten-year anniversary of the mumbai terror attack, the u.s. stands with the people of india in their quest for justice. the attack killed 166 innocents, including six americans. we will never let terrorists win, or even come close to winning!
@realdonaldtrump ....hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met, saw or spoke to a russian during this period? so many campaign workers, people inside from the beginning, ask me why they have not been called (they want to be). there was no collusion & mueller knows it!
@realdonaldtrump when mueller does his final report, will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble, will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those â€śon the other sideâ€ť(whatever happened to podesta?), and will he be putting in statements from.....
@realdonaldtrump mexico should move the flag waving migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries. do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are not coming into the u.s.a. we will close the border permanently if need be. congress, fund the wall!
@realdonaldtrump ....children from parents, as did bush etc., because that is the policy and law. i tried to keep them together but the problem is, when you do that, vast numbers of additional people storm the border. so with obama seperation is fine, but with trump itâ€™s not. fake 60 minutes!
@realdonaldtrump .@60minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the obama administration. in fact a picture of children in jails was used by other fake media to show how bad (cruel) we are, but it was in 2014 during o years. obama separated....
@realdonaldtrump ....for electric cars. general motors made a big china bet years ago when they built plants there (and in mexico) - donâ€™t think that bet is going to pay off. i am here to protect americaâ€™s workers!
@realdonaldtrump very disappointed with general motors and their ceo, mary barra, for closing plants in ohio, michigan and maryland. nothing being closed in mexico & china. the u.s. saved general motors, and this is the thanks we get! we are now looking at cutting all @gm subsidies, including....

@realdonaldtrump ....terrible gang of angry democrats. look at their past, and look where they come from. the now $30,000,000 witch hunt continues and theyâ€™ve got nothing but ruined lives. where is the server? let these terrible people go back to the clinton foundation and â€śjusticeâ€ť department!
@realdonaldtrump ....the fake news media builds bob mueller up as a saint, when in actuality he is the exact opposite. he is doing tremendous damage to our criminal justice system, where he is only looking at one side and not the other. heroes will come of this, and it wonâ€™t be mueller and his...
@realdonaldtrump the phony witch hunt continues, but mueller and his gang of angry dems are only looking at one side, not the other. wait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie. mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue....
@realdonaldtrump on behalf of @flotus melania and the entire trump family, i want to wish you all a very merry christmas! may this christmas season bring peace to your hearts, warmth to your homes, cheer to your spirits and joy to the world! #nctl2018đźž„ pic.twitter.com/xnmjq5jdsu
@realdonaldtrump steel dynamics announced that it will build a brand new 3 million ton steel mill in the southwest that will create 600 good-paying u.s. jobs. steel jobs are coming back to america, just like i predicted. congratulations to steel dynamics!
@realdonaldtrump .....and g.m. would not be closing their plants in ohio, michigan & maryland. get smart congress. also, the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the u.s. for decades. the president has great power on this issue - because of the g.m. event, it is being studied now!
@realdonaldtrump the reason that the small truck business in the u.s. is such a go to favorite is that, for many years, tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country. it is called the â€śchicken tax.â€ť if we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here.....
@realdonaldtrump while the disgusting fake news is doing everything within their power not to report it that way, at least 3 major players are intimating that the angry mueller gang of dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief. this is our joseph mccarthy era!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to senator cindy hyde-smith on your big win in the great state of mississippi. we are all very proud of you!
@realdonaldtrump brenda snipes, in charge of voting in broward county, florida, was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 i voted signs on it. just kidding, she is a fine, very honorable and highly respected voting tactician!
@realdonaldtrump the mueller witch hunt is a total disgrace. they are looking at supposedly stolen crooked hillary clinton emails (even though they donâ€™t want to look at the dnc server), but have no interest in the emails that hillary deleted & acid washed after getting a congressional subpoena!
@realdonaldtrump we have been working hard on this - and itâ€™s only going to get better! https://www.wsj.com/articles/sticking-it-to-pharmawith-competition-1542674076â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump with all of the new books coming out you cannot forget two of the great originals written by @greggjarrett and @judgejeanine pirro. their books both went to #1. go get them now, the phony witch hunt is well explained!
@realdonaldtrump .@dbonginoâ€™s new book, "spygate: the attempted sabotage of donald j. trump," is terrific. he is tough, he is smart, and he really gets it. his book is on sale now, i highly recommend!
@realdonaldtrump ....they have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas. this book is on sale now - a terrific read of a really interesting subject!
@realdonaldtrump .@stephenmoore and arthur laffer, two very talented men, have just completed an incredible book on my economic policies or, as they call it, #trumponomics....
@realdonaldtrump .@stevescalise has written an absolutely fascinating book (back in the game) on the world of d.c. politics, and more. he has experienced so much, in a short period of time. few people have had his bravery or courage, and he has come all the way back. a big power and great person!
@realdonaldtrump ....in argentina with president vladimir putin. i look forward to a meaningful summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!
@realdonaldtrump based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to ukraine from russia, i have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting....
@realdonaldtrump billions of dollars are pouring into the coffers of the u.s.a. because of the tariffs being charged to china, and there is a long way to go. if companies donâ€™t want to pay tariffs, build in the u.s.a. otherwise, lets just make our country richer than ever before!
@realdonaldtrump when will this illegal joseph mccarthy style witch hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever? after wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible?), it has proven only one thing-there was no collusion with russia. so ridiculous!
@realdonaldtrump did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? at the same time mueller and the angry democrats arenâ€™t even looking at the atrocious, and perhaps subversive, crimes that were committed by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats. a total disgrace!
@realdonaldtrump general motors is very counter to what other auto, and other, companies are doing. big steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. auto companies are pouring into the u.s., including bmw, which just announced a major new plant. the u.s.a. is booming!
@realdonaldtrump so much happening with the now discredited witch hunt. this total hoax will be studied for years!
@realdonaldtrump sebastian gorka, a very talented man who i got to know well while he was working at the white house, has just written an excellent book, â€śwhy we fight.â€ť much will be learned from this very good read!

@realdonaldtrump ....lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in russia. put up zero money, zero guarantees and didnâ€™t do the project. witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump oh, i get it! i am a very good developer, happily living my life, when i see our country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). against all odds, i decide to run for president & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail...
@realdonaldtrump arrived in argentina with a very busy two days planned. important meetings scheduled throughout. our great country is extremely well represented. will be very productive!
@realdonaldtrump alan dershowitz: â€śthese are not crimes. he (mueller) has no authority to be a roving commissioner. i donâ€™t see any evidence of crimes.â€ť this is an illegal hoax that should be ended immediately. mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side. where is the ig report?
@realdonaldtrump â€śthis demonstrates the robert mueller and his partisans have no evidence, not a whiff of collusion, between trump and the russians. russian project legal. trump tower meeting (son don), perfectly legal. he wasnâ€™t involved with hacking.â€ť gregg jarrett. a total witch hunt!

@realdonaldtrump bob mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of angry democrats, donâ€™t want the truth, they only want lies. the truth is very bad for their mission!
@realdonaldtrump â€śi will never testify against trump.â€ť this statement was recently made by roger stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about â€śpresident trump.â€ť nice to know that some people still have â€śguts!â€ť

@realdonaldtrump we would save billions of dollars if the democrats would give us the votes to build the wall. either way, people will not be allowed into our country illegally! we will close the entire southern border if necessary. also, stop the drugs!
@realdonaldtrump i am certain that, at some time in the future, president xi and i, together with president putin of russia, will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race. the u.s. spent 716 billion dollars this year. crazy!
@realdonaldtrump president xi and i have a very strong and personal relationship. he and i are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change, on trade and far beyond, between our two great nations. a solution for north korea is a great thing for china and all!
@realdonaldtrump farmers will be a a very big and fast beneficiary of our deal with china. they intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately. we make the finest and cleanest product in the world, and that is what china wants. farmers, i love you!
@realdonaldtrump my meeting in argentina with president xi of china was an extraordinary one. relations with china have taken a big leap forward! very good things will happen. we are dealing from great strength, but china likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. level the field!
@realdonaldtrump china has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into china from the u.s. currently the tariff is 40%.
@realdonaldtrump ....in the world. i want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving americaâ€™s environment. but american taxpayers â€“ and american workers â€“ shouldnâ€™t pay to clean up others countriesâ€™ pollution.
@realdonaldtrump i am glad that my friend @emmanuelmacron and the protestors in paris have agreed with the conclusion i reached two years ago. the paris agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters....
@realdonaldtrump could somebody please explain to the democrats (we need their votes) that our country losses 250 billion dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. top border security, including a wall, is $25 billion. pays for itself in two months. get it done!
@realdonaldtrump .....but if a fair deal is able to be made with china, one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done, i will happily sign. let the negotiations begin. make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump ....i am a tariff man. when people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our nation, i want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. it will always be the best way to maximum out our economic power. we are right now taking in $billions in tariffs. make america rich again
@realdonaldtrump ......on seeing whether or not a real deal with china is actually possible. if it is, we will get it done. china is supposed to start buying agricultural product and more immediately. president xi and i want this deal to happen, and it probably will. but if not remember,......
@realdonaldtrump the negotiations with china have already started. unless extended, they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with president xi in argentina. bob lighthizer will be working closely with steve mnuchin, larry kudlow, wilbur ross and peter navarro.....
@realdonaldtrump looking forward to being with the wonderful bush family at blair house today. the former first lady will be coming over to the white house this morning to be given a tour of the christmas decorations by melania. the elegance & precision of the last two days have been remarkable!

@realdonaldtrump one of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with president xi of china is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly fentanyl coming into the united states. it will now be considered a â€ścontrolled substance.â€ť this could be a game changer on what is.......
@realdonaldtrump very strong signals being sent by china once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from argentina. not to sound naive or anything, but i believe president xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. all subjects discussed!
@realdonaldtrump .....china had agreed to start â€śimmediatelyâ€ť buying u.s. products.â€ť @business
@realdonaldtrump â€śchina officially echoed president donald trumpâ€™s optimism over bilateral trade talks. chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of u.s. soybeans & liquified natural gas, the first sign confirming the claims of president donald trump and the white house that......
@realdonaldtrump .....china does not want tariffs!
@realdonaldtrump we are either going to have a real deal with china, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major tariffs against chinese product being shipped into the united states. ultimately, i believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future....

@realdonaldtrump without the phony russia witch hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (tax & regulation cuts, judgeâ€™s, military, vets, etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by rasmussen. itâ€™s called presidential harassment!

@realdonaldtrump robert mueller and leakinâ€™ lyinâ€™ james comey are best friends, just one of many mueller conflicts of interest. and bye the way, wasnâ€™t the woman in charge of prosecuting jerome corsi (who i do not know) in charge of â€ślegalâ€ť at the corrupt clinton foundation? a total witch hunt...
@realdonaldtrump arizona, together with our military and border patrol, is bracing for a massive surge at a non-walled area. we will not let them through. big danger. nancy and chuck must approve boarder security and the wall!
@realdonaldtrump fake news - the enemy of the people!
@realdonaldtrump trish_regan: â€śdid the fbi follow protocol to obtain the fisa warrant? i donâ€™t think so. the dossier was opposition research funded by opponents. donâ€™t use government resources to take down political foes. weaponizing government for gain.â€ť is this really america? witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump jerome corsi: â€ťthis is not justice, this is not america. this is a political prosecution. the special prosecutor (counsel), to get this plea deal, demanded i lie and violate the law. theyâ€™re the criminals.â€ť he is not alone. 17 angry dems. people forced to lie. sad! @trish_regan
@realdonaldtrump statement from china: â€śthe teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. we are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days.â€ť i agree!
@realdonaldtrump does the fake news media ever mention the fact that republicans, with the very important help of my campaign rallies, won the united states senate, 53 to 47? all i hear is that the open border dems won the house. senate alone approves judges & others. big republican win!
@realdonaldtrump it was my honor to attend todayâ€™s #armynavygame in philadelphia. a great game played all around by our heroes. congratulations @armywp_football on the win! pic.twitter.com/wdlkm6ve2t
@realdonaldtrump great honor to be headed to the army-navy game today. will be there shortly, landing now! pic.twitter.com/byafesq8as
@realdonaldtrump ....left and right, he then woke up from his dream screaming that he lied. next time i go to vietnam i will ask â€śthe dickâ€ť to travel with me!
@realdonaldtrump watched da nang dick blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in vietnam (which he never saw). as the bullets whizzed by da nang dicks head, as he was saving soldiers....
@realdonaldtrump very sad day & night in paris. maybe itâ€™s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive paris agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? the u.s. was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthis is collusion illusion, there is no smoking gun here. at this late date, after all that we have gone through, after millions have been spent, we have no russian collusion. there is nothing impeachable here.â€ť @geraldorivera time for the witch hunt to end!
@realdonaldtrump ....i am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our country! date of transition to be determined.
@realdonaldtrump i am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star general mark milley, chief of staff of the united states army â€“ as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, replacing general joe dunford, who will be retiring....
@realdonaldtrump after two years and millions of pages of documents (and a cost of over $30,000,000), no collusion!
@realdonaldtrump the idea of a european military didnâ€™t work out too well in w.w. i or 2. but the u.s. was there for you, and always will be. all we ask is that you pay your fair share of nato. germany is paying 1% while the u.s. pays 4.3% of a much larger gdp - to protect europe. fairness!
@realdonaldtrump the paris agreement isnâ€™t working out so well for paris. protests and riots all over france. people do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. chanting â€śwe want trump!â€ť love france.
@realdonaldtrump the trump administration has accomplished more than any other u.s. administration in its first two (not even) years of existence, & we are having a great time doing it! all of this despite the fake news media, which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the enemy of the people!
@realdonaldtrump leakinâ€™ james comey must have set a record for who lied the most to congress in one day. his friday testimony was so untruthful! this whole deal is a rigged fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that i could not become president. they are now exposed!
@realdonaldtrump on 245 occasions, former fbi director james comey told house investigators he didnâ€™t know, didnâ€™t recall, or couldnâ€™t remember things when asked. opened investigations on 4 americans (not 2) - didnâ€™t know who signed off and didnâ€™t know christopher steele. all lies!
@realdonaldtrump ....which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a civil case, like obamaâ€™s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. lawyerâ€™s liability if he made a mistake, not me). cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump â€śdemocrats canâ€™t find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james comeyâ€™s testimony. no smocking gun...no collusion.â€ť @foxnews thatâ€™s because there was no collusion. so now the dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,...
@realdonaldtrump i am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of white house chief of staff. fake news has been saying with certainty it was nick ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #maga agenda. i will be making a decision soon!
@realdonaldtrump thanks to leader mcconnell for agreeing to bring a senate vote on criminal justice this week! these historic changes will make communities safer and save tremendous taxpayers dollars. it brings much needed hope to many families during the holiday season.
@realdonaldtrump "â€śi donâ€™t care what you think of the president...it cannot bleed over to the fbi...comey is confirming there is bias in the fbi...â€ť -chris swecker"
@realdonaldtrump james comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow democrats to take back the white house in 2020. in other words, he is and has been a democrat. comey had no right heading the fbi at any time, but especially after his mind exploded!
@realdonaldtrump fake news has it purposely wrong. many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the white house chief of staff position. why wouldnâ€™t someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in washington. please report news correctly. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump very productive conversations going on with china! watch for some important announcements!
@realdonaldtrump great job by michael anton on @foxandfriends. a true national security expert!
@realdonaldtrump ....people do not yet realize how much of the wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. if the democrats do not give us the votes to secure our country, the military will build the remaining sections of the wall. they know how important it is!
@realdonaldtrump .....i look forward to my meeting with chuck schumer & nancy pelosi. in 2006, democrats voted for a wall, and they were right to do so. today, they no longer want border security. they will fight it at all cost, and nancy must get votes for speaker. but the wall will get built...
@realdonaldtrump ....however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do not want border security. they want open borders for anyone to come in. this brings large scale crime and disease. our southern border is now secure and will remain that way.......
@realdonaldtrump .....ice, border patrol and our military have done a fantastic job of securing our southern border. a great wall would be, however, a far easier & less expensive solution. we have already built large new sections & fully renovated others, making them like new. the democrats,.....
@realdonaldtrump despite the large caravans that were forming and heading to our country, people have not been able to get through our newly built walls, makeshift walls & fences, or border patrol officers & military. they are now staying in mexico or going back to their original countries.......
@realdonaldtrump â€śformer fbi director james comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the democrats paid for that phony trump dossier.â€ť @loudobbs details on tuesday night.
@realdonaldtrump james comeyâ€™s behind closed doors testimony reveals that â€śthere was not evidence of campaign collusionâ€ť with russia when he left the fbi. in other words, the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started!
@realdonaldtrump .@flotus melania will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight on @foxnews at 9:00pme!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats and president obama gave iran 150 billion dollars and got nothing, but they canâ€™t give 5 billion dollars for national security and a wall?
@realdonaldtrump another very bad terror attack in france. we are going to strengthen our borders even more. chuck and nancy must give us the votes to get additional border security!

@realdonaldtrump ....she will probably be given a pass, despite their terrible ratings. congratulations to @richardgrenell, our great ambassador to germany, for having the courage to take this horrible issue on!
@realdonaldtrump if it was a conservative that said what â€ścrazedâ€ť mika brzezinski stated on her show yesterday, using a certain horrible term, that person would be banned permanently from television....
@realdonaldtrump witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump they gave general flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the fbi said he didnâ€™t lie and they overrode the fbi. they want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements. sad!......
@realdonaldtrump ....guilty even on a civil basis. those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. as a lawyer, michael has great liability to me!
@realdonaldtrump ....stated that i did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance. cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not...
@realdonaldtrump i never directed michael cohen to break the law. he was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. it is called â€śadvice of counsel,â€ť and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made. that is why they get paid. despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly......
@realdonaldtrump i often stated, â€śone way or the other, mexico is going to pay for the wall.â€ť this has never changed. our new deal with mexico (and canada), the usmca, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-usa nafta deal, that just by the money we save, mexico is paying for the wall!
@realdonaldtrump ....i look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to make america great again! john will be staying until the end of the year. he is a great patriot and i want to personally thank him for his service!
@realdonaldtrump i am pleased to announce that mick mulvaney, director of the office of management & budget, will be named acting white house chief of staff, replacing general john kelly, who has served our country with distinction. mick has done an outstanding job while in the administration....
@realdonaldtrump thank you to @tim_cook for agreeing to expand operations in the u.s. and thereby creating thousands of jobs! https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1073210372541243392â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump ....kim jong un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people. we are doing just fine!
@realdonaldtrump many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with north korea - i always reply by saying we are in no hurry, there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country....
@realdonaldtrump china just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our trade war with them. they have just suspended u.s. tariff hikes. u.s. is doing very well. china wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. it could happen, and rather soon!
@realdonaldtrump wow, 19,000 texts between lisa page and her lover, peter s of the fbi, in charge of the russia hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news. witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump the pathetic and dishonest weekly standard, run by failed prognosticator bill kristol (who, like many others, never had a clue), is flat broke and out of business. too bad. may it rest in peace!
@realdonaldtrump never in the history of our country has the â€śpressâ€ť been more dishonest than it is today. stories that should be good, are bad. stories that should be bad, are horrible. many stories, like with the real story on russia, clinton & the dnc, seldom get reported. too bad!
@realdonaldtrump .......the trump administration will be announcing the new secretary of the interior next week.
@realdonaldtrump secretary of the interior @ryanzinke will be leaving the administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years. ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and i want to thank him for his service to our nation.......
@realdonaldtrump wow, but not surprisingly, obamacare was just ruled unconstitutional by a highly respected judge in texas. great news for america!
@realdonaldtrump as i predicted all along, obamacare has been struck down as an unconstitutional disaster! now congress must pass a strong law that provides great healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. mitch and nancy, get it done!
@realdonaldtrump for the record, there were many people who wanted to be the white house chief of staff. mick m will do a great job!
@realdonaldtrump ....the russian witch hunt hoax, started as the â€śinsurance policyâ€ť long before i even got elected, is very bad for our country. they are entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. nothing to do with collusion. a democrat scam!
@realdonaldtrump ....a persecution of the president.â€ť daniel henninger, the wall street journal. thank you, people are starting to see and understand what this witch hunt is all about. jeff sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total hoax to get started in the first place!
@realdonaldtrump â€śit looks here as though general flynnâ€™s defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to donald trump without quite knowing what that crime might be. it stops looking like prosecution and more looking like......
@realdonaldtrump required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of rod blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a jerome corsi. if that doesnâ€™t tell you something about what has been going on in our country, nothing will. very sad!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats policy of child seperation on the border during the obama administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the obama years. however, if you donâ€™t separate, far more people will come. smugglers use the kids!
@realdonaldtrump judge ken starr, former solicitor generel & independent counsel, just stated that, after two years, â€śthere is no evidence or proof of collusionâ€ť & further that â€śthere is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the president.â€ť thank you judge. @foxnews
@realdonaldtrump at the request of many, i will be reviewing the case of a â€śu.s. military hero,â€ť major matt golsteyn, who is charged with murder. he could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @petehegseth @foxnews
@realdonaldtrump remember, michael cohen only became a â€śratâ€ť after the fbi did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the witch hunt was illegally started. they broke into an attorneyâ€™s office! why didnâ€™t they break into the dnc to get the server, or crookedâ€™s office?
@realdonaldtrump so where are all the missing text messages between fired fbi agents peter s and the lovely lisa page, his lover. just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. what an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted witch hunt moves ever so slowly forward. want them!
@realdonaldtrump a real scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like nbc & democrat spin machines like saturday night live. it is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and demonstrative commercials. should be tested in courts, canâ€™t be legal? only defame & belittle! collusion?
@realdonaldtrump today i am making good on my promise to defend our farmers & ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. i have authorized secretary perdue to implement the second round of market facilitation payments. our economy is stronger than everâ€“we stand with our farmers!
@realdonaldtrump anytime you hear a democrat saying that you can have good border security without a wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!
@realdonaldtrump it is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, paris is burning and china way down, the fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. take the victory!
@realdonaldtrump the deductible which comes with obamacare is so high that it is practically not even useable! hurts families badly. we have a chance, working with the democrats, to deliver great healthcare! a confirming supreme court decision will lead to great healthcare results for americans!

@realdonaldtrump michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims. the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax, but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?
@realdonaldtrump ....will never be proven and are likely false.â€ť thank you to michael isikoff, yahoo, for honesty. what this means is that the fisa warrants and the whole russian witch hunt is a fraud and a hoax which should be ended immediately. also, it was paid for by crooked hillary & dnc!
@realdonaldtrump russia dossier reporter now doubts dopey christopher steeleâ€™s claims! â€śwhen you get into the details of the steele dossier, the specific allegations, we have not seen the evidence to support them. thereâ€™s good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations.....
@realdonaldtrump illegal immigration costs the united states more than 200 billion dollars a year. how was this allowed to happen?
@realdonaldtrump facebook, twitter and google are so biased toward the dems it is ridiculous! twitter, in fact, has made it much more difficult for people to join @realdonaldtrump. they have removed many names & greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. they have acknowledged-done nothing!
@realdonaldtrump i hope the people over at the fed will read todayâ€™s wall street journal editorial before they make yet another mistake. also, donâ€™t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. stop with the 50 bâ€™s. feel the market, donâ€™t just go by meaningless numbers. good luck!
@realdonaldtrump good luck today in court to general michael flynn. will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about russian collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. there was no collusion!
@realdonaldtrump biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted mueller witch hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded text messages between peter strzok and his fbi lover, lisa page, were purposely & illegally deleted. would have explained whole hoax, which is now under protest!
@realdonaldtrump after historic victories against isis, itâ€™s time to bring our great young people home! pic.twitter.com/xonjfzqftp
@realdonaldtrump ....in any event, it goes on and on & the new ag, who is now being replaced by yet another ag (who openly campaigned on a get trump agenda), does little else but rant, rave & politic against me. will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of â€śjustice.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump ...sleazebag ag eric schneiderman, who has since resigned over horrific women abuse, when i wanted to close the foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. shady eric was head of new yorkers for clinton, and refused to even look at the corrupt clinton foundation......
@realdonaldtrump the trump foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking no fees, rent, salaries etcetera. now, as usual, i am getting slammed by cuomo and the dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by.....
@realdonaldtrump we have defeated isis in syria, my only reason for being there during the trump presidency.
@realdonaldtrump mexico is paying (indirectly) for the wall through the new usmca, the replacement for nafta! far more money coming to the u.s. because of the tremendous dangers at the border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the united states military will build the wall!
@realdonaldtrump in our country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to border security and the military, the democrats fight to the death. we won on the military, which is being completely rebuilt. one way or the other, we will win on the wall!
@realdonaldtrump ....this will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it. in addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved. i look forward to signing this into law!
@realdonaldtrump america is the greatest country in the world and my job is to fight for all citizens, even those who have made mistakes. congratulations to the senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic criminal justice reform bill....
@realdonaldtrump ....it will be beautiful and, at the same time, give our country the security that our citizens deserve. it will go up fast and save us billions of dollars a month once completed!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a concrete wall - but we are not building a concrete wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it....
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to @marthamcsally on her appointment by governor @dougducey as the great new senator from arizona - i have no doubt she will do a fantastic job!
@realdonaldtrump ....equipment. general mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. a new secretary of defense will be named shortly. i greatly thank jim for his service!
@realdonaldtrump general jim mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of february, after having served my administration as secretary of defense for the past two years. during jimâ€™s tenure, tremendous progress has been made, especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting....

@realdonaldtrump congress just passed the criminal justice reform bill known as the #firststepact. congratulations! this is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody. when both parties work together we can keep our country safer. a wonderful thing for the u.s.a.!!
@realdonaldtrump when i begrudgingly signed the omnibus bill, i was promised the wall and border security by leadership. would be done by end of year (now). it didnâ€™t happen! we foolishly fight for border security for other countries - but not for our beloved u.s.a. not good!
@realdonaldtrump with so much talk about the wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our southern border by border patrol, ice and our great military. remember the caravans? well, they didnâ€™t get through and none are forming or on their way. border is tight. fake news silent!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats, who know steel slats (wall) are necessary for border security, are putting politics over country. what they are just beginning to realize is that i will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect border security. u.s.a. wins!
@realdonaldtrump ....russia, iran, syria & many others are not happy about the u.s. leaving, despite what the fake news says, because now they will have to fight isis and others, who they hate, without us. i am building by far the most powerful military in the world. isis hits us they are doomed!
@realdonaldtrump does the usa want to be the policeman of the middle east, getting nothing but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? do we want to be there forever? time for others to finally fight.....
@realdonaldtrump getting out of syria was no surprise. iâ€™ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when i very publicly wanted to do it, i agreed to stay longer. russia, iran, syria & others are the local enemy of isis. we were doing there work. time to come home & rebuild. #maga
@realdonaldtrump â€śiâ€™m proud of the president today to hear that he is declaring victory in syria.â€ť senator rand paul. â€śi couldnâ€™t agree more with the presidents decision. by definition, this is the opposite of an obama decision. senator mike lee
@realdonaldtrump â€śtrump gets no credit for what heâ€™s done in the middle east.â€ť @ingrahamangle so true, thank you laura!
@realdonaldtrump col. jim carafano on @ingrahamangle â€śtrump has made the middle east a better place. when trump came into office, isis was running amuck in the middle east. over a million refugees poured into western europe - none of that is happening today. thatâ€™s all due to trump.â€ť

@realdonaldtrump the democrats now own the shutdown!
@realdonaldtrump general anthony tata, author, â€śdark winter.â€ť i think the president is making the exact right move in syria. all the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on isis intelligence and gave rise to isis.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump there has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on china or russia - never, just look at the facts. the fake news tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.
@realdonaldtrump thank you @stevedaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on desperately needed border security! have my total support.
@realdonaldtrump mitch, use the nuclear option and get it done! our country is counting on you!
@realdonaldtrump even president ronald reagan tried for 8 years to build a border wall, or fence, and was unable to do so. others also have tried. we will get it done, one way or the other!
@realdonaldtrump shutdown today if democrats do not vote for border security!
@realdonaldtrump house republican vote, 217-185.
@realdonaldtrump the democrats, whose votes we need in the senate, will probably vote against border security and the wall even though they know it is desperately needed. if the dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. people donâ€™t want open borders and crime!
@realdonaldtrump no matter what happens today in the senate, republican house members should be very proud of themselves. they flew back to washington from all parts of the world in order to vote for border security and the wall. not one democrat voted yes, and we won big. i am very proud of you!
@realdonaldtrump .....on a border is only effective in conjunction with a wall. properly designed and built walls work, and the democrats are lying when they say they donâ€™t. in israel the wall is 99.9% successful. will not be any different on our southern border! hundreds of $billions saved!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a wall, calling it old fashioned. the fact is there is nothing elseâ€™s that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. itâ€™s like the wheel, there is nothing better. i know technology better than anyone, & technology.....
@realdonaldtrump senator mitch mcconnell should fight for the wall and border security as hard as he fought for anything. he will need democrat votes, but as shown in the house, good things happen. if enough dems donâ€™t vote, it will be a democrat shutdown! house republicans were great yesterday!
@realdonaldtrump soon to be speaker nancy pelosi said, last week live from the oval office, that the republicans didnâ€™t have the votes for border security. today the house republicans voted and won, 217-185. nancy does not have to apologize. all i want is great border security!
@realdonaldtrump thank you to our great republican members of congress for your vote to fund border security and the wall. the final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. so proud of you all. now on to the senate!
@realdonaldtrump i will not be going to florida because of the shutdown - staying in the white house! #maga

@realdonaldtrump i won an election, said to be one of the greatest of all time, based on getting out of endless & costly foreign wars & also based on strong borders which will keep our country safe. we fight for the borders of other countries, but we wonâ€™t fight for the borders of our own!
@realdonaldtrump the crisis of illegal activity at our southern border is real and will not stop until we build a great steel barrier or wall. let work begin!
@realdonaldtrump will be having lunch in white house residence with large group concerning border security.
@realdonaldtrump ....going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left. when i became president, isis was going wild. now isis is largely defeated and other local countries, including turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. weâ€™re coming home!
@realdonaldtrump i am in the white house, working hard. news reports concerning the shutdown and syria are mostly fake. we are negotiating with the democrats on desperately needed border security (gangs, drugs, human trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay. on syria, we were originally...
@realdonaldtrump our great country must have border security! pic.twitter.com/zgcyygmf3a
@realdonaldtrump wishing supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg a full and speedy recovery!
@realdonaldtrump thanks @randpaul â€śi am very proud of the president. this is exactly what he promised, and i think the people agree with him. weâ€™ve been at war too long and in too many places...spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere. heâ€™s different...thatâ€™s why he got elected.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump .....bob corker was responsible for giving us the horrible iran nuclear deal, which i ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. i said no and the game was over. #maga i love tennessee!
@realdonaldtrump senator bob corker just stated that, â€śiâ€™m so priveledged to serve in the senate for twelve years, and thatâ€™s what i told the people of our state thatâ€™s what iâ€™d do, serve for two terms.â€ť but that is not true - wanted to run but poll numbers tanked when i wouldnâ€™t endorse him.....
@realdonaldtrump we signed two pieces of major legislation this week, criminal justice reform and the farm bill. these are two big deals, but all the fake news media wants to talk about is â€śthe mistakeâ€ť of bringing our young people back home from the never ending wars. it all began 19 years ago!
@realdonaldtrump unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in indonesia. more than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for. we are praying for recovery and healing. america is with you!
@realdonaldtrump i just had a long and productive call with president @rt_erdogan of turkey. we discussed isis, our mutual involvement in syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of u.s. troops from the area. after many years they are coming home. we also discussed heavily expanded trade.
@realdonaldtrump i am pleased to announce that our very talented deputy secretary of defense, patrick shanahan, will assume the title of acting secretary of defense starting january 1, 2019. patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as deputy, & previously boeing. he will be great!
@realdonaldtrump the only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our country is with a wall or barrier. drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned wall that works!
@realdonaldtrump when president obama ingloriously fired jim mattis, i gave him a second chance. some thought i shouldnâ€™t, i thought i should. interesting relationship-but i also gave all of the resources that he never really had. allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of u.s.
@realdonaldtrump if anybody but your favorite president, donald j. trump, announced that, after decimating isis in syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in america. with me, hit hard instead by the fake news media. crazy!
@realdonaldtrump brett mcgurk, who i do not know, was appointed by president obama in 2015. was supposed to leave in february but he just resigned prior to leaving. grandstander? the fake news is making such a big deal about this nothing event!
@realdonaldtrump i am in the oval office & just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the wall in texas. we are already building and renovating many miles of wall, some complete. democrats must end shutdown and finish funding. billions of dollars, & lives, will be saved!
@realdonaldtrump christmas eve briefing with my team working on north korea â€“ progress being made. looking forward to my next summit with chairman kim! pic.twitter.com/zpttdbrp0o
@realdonaldtrump i am all alone (poor me) in the white house waiting for the democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed border security. at some point the democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our country more money than the border wall we are all talking about. crazy!
@realdonaldtrump saudi arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild syria, instead of the united states. see? isnâ€™t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a great country, the u.s., that is 5000 miles away. thanks to saudi a!
@realdonaldtrump the wall is different than the 25 billion dollars in border security. the complete wall will be built with the shutdown money plus funds already in hand. the reporting has been inaccurate on the point. the problem is, without the wall, much of the rest of dollars are wasted!
@realdonaldtrump i never â€ślashed outâ€ť at the acting attorney general of the u.s., a man for whom i have great respect. this is a made up story, one of many, by the fake news media!
@realdonaldtrump the only problem our economy has is the fed. they donâ€™t have a feel for the market, they donâ€™t understand necessary trade wars or strong dollars or even democrat shutdowns over borders. the fed is like a powerful golfer who canâ€™t score because he has no touch - he canâ€™t putt!
@realdonaldtrump america is respected again!
@realdonaldtrump for all of the sympathizers out there of brett mcgurk remember, he was the obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 billion dollars in cash & sending it to iran as part of the horrific iran nuclear deal (now terminated) approved by little bob corker.
@realdonaldtrump ....we are substantially subsidizing the militaries of many very rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the u.s., and our taxpayers, on trade. general mattis did not see this as a problem. i do, and it is being fixed!
@realdonaldtrump to those few senators who think i donâ€™t like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, i do. what i donâ€™t like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the united states, both in military protection and trade...
@realdonaldtrump virtually every democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a border wall or fence. it was only when i made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our country unchecked, that they turned against it. desperately needed!
@realdonaldtrump president @rt_erdogan of turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of isis in syria....and he is a man who can do it plus, turkey is right â€śnext door.â€ť our troops are coming home!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe president has been remarkable. i do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment, and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is.â€ť thank you to tammy bruce and steve hilton. presidential harassment has been with me from the beginning!
@realdonaldtrump the most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our southern border. we need border security, and as everyone knows, you canâ€™t have border security without a wall. the drones & technology are just bells and whistles. safety for america!
@realdonaldtrump mitch mcconnell just told a group of people, and me, that he has been in the u.s. senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best & most productive of his career. tax & regulation cuts, va choice, farm bill, criminal justice reform, judgeships & much more. great!
@realdonaldtrump â€śit should not be the job of america to replace regimes around the world. this is what president trump recognized in iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and heâ€™s right...the generals still donâ€™t get the mistake.â€ť @randpaul
@realdonaldtrump i hope everyone, even the fake news media, is having a great christmas! our country is doing very well. we are securing our borders, making great new trade deals, and bringing our troops back home. we are finally putting america first. merry christmas! #maga
@realdonaldtrump .@flotus melania and i were honored to visit our incredible troops at al asad air base in iraq. god bless the u.s.a.! pic.twitter.com/rdlhitdvm1
@realdonaldtrump cnn & others within the fake news universe were going wild about my signing maga hats for our military in iraq and germany. if these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, i will sign. can you imagine my saying no? we brought or gave no hats as the fake news first reported!
@realdonaldtrump this isnâ€™t about the wall, everybody knows that a wall will work perfectly (in israel the wall works 99.9%). this is only about the dems not letting donald trump & the republicans have a win. they may have the 10 senate votes, but we have the issue, border security. 2020!
@realdonaldtrump brad blakeman: â€śthe american people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. the president says look, this is your neighborhood, youâ€™ve got to stand up to protect yourselves. donâ€™t always look to america.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump i totally agree! https://twitter.com/barackobama/status/30091811594698752â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump there is right now a full scale manhunt going on in california for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. time to get tough on border security. build the wall!
@realdonaldtrump â€śborder patrol agents want the wall.â€ť democratâ€™s say they donâ€™t want the wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they donâ€™t want ice. they donâ€™t have much to campaign on, do they? an open southern border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!
@realdonaldtrump the reason the daca for wall deal didnâ€™t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the nineth circuit allowed daca to remain, thereby setting up a supreme court case. after ruling, dems dropped deal - and thatâ€™s where we are today, democrat obstruction of the needed wall.
@realdonaldtrump the democrats obstruction of the desperately needed wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their obstruction of 350 great people wanting & expecting to come into government after being delayed for more than two years, a u.s. record!
@realdonaldtrump have the democrats finally realized that we desperately need border security and a wall on the southern border. need to stop drugs, human trafficking,gang members & criminals from coming into our country. do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats?
@realdonaldtrump just returned from visiting our troops in iraq and germany. one thing is certain, we have incredible people representing our country - people that know how to win!
@realdonaldtrump thank you to sean parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to melania and i in iraq and germany. great things are happening!
@realdonaldtrump .....honduras, guatemala and el salvador are doing nothing for the united states but taking our money. word is that a new caravan is forming in honduras and they are doing nothing about it. we will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of u.s. for years!
@realdonaldtrump .....close the southern border. bring our car industry back into the united states where it belongs. go back to pre-nafta, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to mexico. either we build (finish) the wall or we close the border......
@realdonaldtrump ....the united states looses soooo much money on trade with mexico under nafta, over 75 billion dollars a year (not including drug money which would be many times that amount), that i would consider closing the southern border a â€śprofit making operation.â€ť we build a wall or.....
@realdonaldtrump we will be forced to close the southern border entirely if the obstructionist democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with. hard to believe there was a congress & president who would approve!
@realdonaldtrump 2018 is being called â€śthe year of the workerâ€ť by steve moore, co-author of â€śtrumponomics.â€ť it was indeed a great year for the american worker with the â€śbest job market in 50 years, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and hispanics and all workers. big wage gains.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump for those that naively ask why didnâ€™t the republicans get approval to build the wall over the last year, it is because in the senate we need 10 democrat votes, and they will gives us â€śnoneâ€ť for border security! now we have to do it the hard way, with a shutdown. too bad! @foxnews
@realdonaldtrump ...children in question were very sick before they were given over to border patrol. the father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadnâ€™t given her water in days. border patrol needs the wall and it will all end. they are working so hard & getting so little credit!
@realdonaldtrump any deaths of children or others at the border are strictly the fault of the democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. they canâ€™t. if we had a wall, they wouldnâ€™t even try! the two.....
@realdonaldtrump just had a long and very good call with president xi of china. deal is moving along very well. if made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. big progress being made!
@realdonaldtrump i am in the white house waiting for the democrats to come on over and make a deal on border security. from what i hear, they are spending so much time on presidential harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!
@realdonaldtrump the mueller angry democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 text messages between fbi agent lisa page and her lover, agent peter s. these texts were asked for and invaluable to the truth of the witch hunt hoax. this is a total obstruction of justice. all texts demanded!
@realdonaldtrump president and mrs. obama built/has a ten foot wall around their d.c. mansion/compound. i agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. the u.s. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!
@realdonaldtrump great work by my administration over the holidays to save coast guard pay during this #schumershutdown. no thanks to the democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of americans!
@realdonaldtrump veterans on president trumpâ€™s handling of border security - 62% approval rating. on being a strong leader - 59%. ap poll. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump â€śit turns out to be true now, that the department of justice and the fbi, under president obama, rigged the investigation for hillary and really turned the screws on trump, and now it looks like in a corrupt & illegal way. the facts are out now. whole hoax exposed. @jessebwatters
@realdonaldtrump â€śabsolutely nothingâ€ť (on russian collusion). kimberley strassel, the wall street journal. the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics. the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats!

@realdonaldtrump heads of countries are calling wanting to know why senator schumer is not approving their otherwise approved ambassadors!? likewise in government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from....
@realdonaldtrump itâ€™s incredible how democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a wall doesnâ€™t work. it does, and properly built, almost 100%! they say itâ€™s old technology - but so is the wheel. they now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!
@realdonaldtrump iâ€™m in the oval office. democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for border security, including the wall. you voted yes in 2006 and 2013. one more yes, but with me in office, iâ€™ll get it built, and fast!
@realdonaldtrump i am the only person in america who could say that, â€śiâ€™m bringing our great troops back home, with victory,â€ť and get bad press. it is fake news and pundits who have failed for years that are doing the complaining. if i stayed in endless wars forever, they would still be unhappy!
@realdonaldtrump i campaigned on border security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful wall. our southern border has long been an â€śopen wound,â€ť where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our country. dems should get back here an fix now!
@realdonaldtrump .....except the results are far better than i ever said they were going to be! i campaigned against the never ending wars, remember!
@realdonaldtrump ...i campaigned on getting out of syria and other places. now when i start getting out the fake news media, or some failed generals who were unable to do the job before i arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working. just doing what i said i was going to do!
@realdonaldtrump if anybody but donald trump did what i did in syria, which was an isis loaded mess when i became president, they would be a national hero. isis is mostly gone, weâ€™re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting isis remnants......
@realdonaldtrump an all concrete wall was never abandoned, as has been reported by the media. some areas will be all concrete but the experts at border patrol prefer a wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). makes sense to me!
@realdonaldtrump do you think itâ€™s just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? low gas prices are like another tax cut!
@realdonaldtrump â€śkim jong un says north korea will not make or test nuclear weapons, or give them to others - & he is ready to meet president trump anytime.â€ť pbs news hour. i also look forward to meeting with chairman kim who realizes so well that north korea possesses great economic potential!

@realdonaldtrump gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. this would be good!
@realdonaldtrump border security and the wall â€śthingâ€ť and shutdown is not where nancy pelosi wanted to start her tenure as speaker! letâ€™s make a deal?
@realdonaldtrump "congratulations to president @jairbolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech - the u.s.a. is with you!"

@realdonaldtrump the democrats, much as i suspected, have allocated no money for a new wall. so imaginative! the problem is, without a wall there can be no real border security - and our country must finally have a strong and secure southern border!
@realdonaldtrump happy new year!
@realdonaldtrump happy new year to everyone, including the haters and the fake news media! 2019 will be a fantastic year for those not suffering from trump derangement syndrome. just calm down and enjoy the ride, great things are happening for our country!
@realdonaldtrump dr. sebastian gorka, a very good and talented guy, has a great new book just out, â€śwhy we fight.â€ť lots of insight - enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump ...remember this. throughout the ages some things never get better and never change. you have walls and you have wheels. it was always that way and it will always be that way! please explain to the democrats that there can never be a replacement for a good old fashioned wall!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats will probably submit a bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives nothing to border security, namely the wall. you see, without the wall there can be no border security - the technology â€śstuffâ€ť is just, by comparison, meaningless bells & whistles...
@realdonaldtrump mexico is paying for the wall through the many billions of dollars a year that the u.s.a. is saving through the new trade deal, the usmca, that will replace the horrendous nafta trade deal, which has so badly hurt our country. mexico & canada will also thrive - good for all!
@realdonaldtrump mexico is paying for the wall through the new usmca trade deal. much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. we have done a lot of work. $5.6 billion dollars that house has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of national security. quick payback!
@realdonaldtrump here we go with mitt romney, but so fast! question will be, is he a flake? i hope not. would much prefer that mitt focus on border security and so many other things where he can be helpful. i won big, and he didnâ€™t. he should be happy for all republicans. be a team player & win!
@realdonaldtrump for far too long senate democrats have been obstructing more than 350 nominations. these great americans left their jobs to serve our country, but canâ€™t because dems are blocking them, some for two years-historic record. passed committees, but schumer putting them on hold. bad!

@realdonaldtrump the shutdown is only because of the 2020 presidential election. the democrats know they canâ€™t win based on all of the achievements of â€śtrump,â€ť so they are going all out on the desperately needed wall and border security - and presidential harassment. for them, strictly politics!

@realdonaldtrump how do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no collusion with russia, it was the dems that colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular republican in party history 93%?
@realdonaldtrump as i have stated many times, if the democrats take over the house or senate, there will be disruption to the financial markets. we won the senate, they won the house. things will settle down. they only want to impeach me because they know they canâ€™t win in 2020, too much success!

@realdonaldtrump great tweet today by tyler q. houlton @spoxdhs on the #fakenews being put out by @cnn, a proud member of the opposition party. @tsa is doing a great job!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats want billions of dollars for foreign aid, but they donâ€™t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our border. figure that one out!
@realdonaldtrump we are working hard at the border, but we need a wall! in 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including ms-13, apprehended. a big human trafficking problem.
@realdonaldtrump i donâ€™t care that most of the workers not getting paid are democrats, i want to stop the shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on strong border security! i am in the white house ready to go, where are the dems?
@realdonaldtrump many people currently a part of my opposition, including president obama & the dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. these are civil cases. they paid a fine & settled. while no big deal, i did not commit a campaign violation!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats could solve the shutdown problem in a very short period of time. all they have to do is approve real border security (including a wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! this would be so easy to do!
@realdonaldtrump great support coming from all sides for border security (including wall) on our very dangerous southern border. teams negotiating this weekend! washington post and nbc reporting of events, including fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!

@realdonaldtrump v.p. mike pence and group had a productive meeting with the schumer/pelosi representatives today. many details of border security were discussed. we are now planning a steel barrier rather than concrete. it is both stronger & less obtrusive. good solution, and made in the u.s.a.
@realdonaldtrump our great military has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the uss cole. we have just killed the leader of that attack, jamal al-badawi. our work against al qaeda continues. we will never stop in our fight against radical islamic terrorism!
@realdonaldtrump excited to see our friends in egypt opening the biggest cathedral in the middle east. president el-sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future!
@realdonaldtrump ....the only reason they do not want to build a wall is that walls work! 99% of our illegal border crossings will end, crime in our country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! a properly planned and constructed wall will pay for itself many times a year!
@realdonaldtrump â€śwe simply cannot allow people to pour into the united states undetected, undocumented, unchecked...â€ť barrack obama, 2005. i voted, when i was a senator, to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...â€ť hillary clinton, 2015.

@realdonaldtrump congressman adam smith, the new chairman of the house armed services committee, just stated, â€śyes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. itâ€™s been done a number of times.â€ť no doubt, but letâ€™s get our deal done in congress!
@realdonaldtrump ....the fake news media in our country is the real opposition party. it is truly the enemy of the people! we must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!
@realdonaldtrump ...the fake news will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the trump administration, and me, look as bad as possible. they use non-existent sources & write stories that are total fiction. our country is doing so well, yet this is a sad day in america!
@realdonaldtrump with all of the success that our country is having, including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts, the fake news & totally dishonest media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse. many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the truth!...
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to a truly great football team, the clemson tigers, on an incredible win last night against a powerful alabama team. a big win also for the great state of south carolina. look forward to seeing the team, and their brilliant coach, for the second time at the w.h.

@realdonaldtrump â€śthe president is the biggest and best supporter of the steel industry in many years. we are now doing really well. the tariffs let us compete. was unfair that the steel industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws. very positive outcome.â€ť mark glyptis, united steelworkers
@realdonaldtrump economic numbers looking really good. can you imagine if i had long term zero interest rates to play with like the past administration, rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. that would have been so easy! still, markets up big since 2016 election!
@realdonaldtrump endless wars, especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago, & those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing, will eventually come to a glorious end!
@realdonaldtrump just left a meeting with chuck and nancy, a total waste of time. i asked what is going to happen in 30 days if i quickly open things up, are you going to approve border security which includes a wall or steel barrier? nancy said, no. i said bye-bye, nothing else works!
@realdonaldtrump thank you to all of america's brave police, deputies, sheriffs, and federal law enforcement on national law enforcement appreciation day! we love you and will always support you. pic.twitter.com/kgl6kpmpdy
@realdonaldtrump billions of dollars are sent to the state of california for forest fires that, with proper forest management, would never happen. unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, i have ordered fema to send no more money. it is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!
@realdonaldtrump our country is doing so well in so many ways. great jobs numbers, with a record setting december. we are rebuilding our military. vets finally have choice & accountability. economy & gdp are strong. tax & regular cuts historic. trade deals great. but we must fix our southern border!
@realdonaldtrump thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my oval office speech. a very interesting experience!
@realdonaldtrump from the southern border.... pic.twitter.com/vgsf5nezuh
@realdonaldtrump because of the democrats intransigence on border security and the great importance of safety for our nation, i am respectfully cancelling my very important trip to davos, switzerland for the world economic forum. my warmest regards and apologies to the @wef!
@realdonaldtrump president obama, thank you for your great support â€“ i have been saying this all along! pic.twitter.com/l506g9aq4z
@realdonaldtrump make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump getting ready to leave for the great state of texas! #maga
@realdonaldtrump â€śgreat support for border security and the wall.â€ť @foxandfriends even greater than anyone would know! â€śpresidents supporters do not want him to cave.â€ť @stevedoocy i wonâ€™t!
@realdonaldtrump there is great unity with the republicans in the house and senate, despite the fake news media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. the opposition party & the dems know we must have strong border security, but donâ€™t want to give â€śtrumpâ€ť another one of many wins!
@realdonaldtrump cryin chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that i â€śslammed the table & walked out of the room. he had a temper tantrum.â€ť because i knew he would say that, and after nancy said no to proper border security, i politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!
@realdonaldtrump gave an off the record luncheon, somewhat of a white house tradition or custom, to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!
@realdonaldtrump the mainstream media has never been more dishonest than it is now. nbc and msnbc are going crazy. they report stories, purposely, the exact opposite of the facts. they are truly the opposition party working with the dems. may even be worse than fake news cnn, if that is possible!
@realdonaldtrump .@cnn called a san diego news station (@kusinews) for negative reports on the wall. when the station said that walls work, cnn no longer had interest. #fakenews pic.twitter.com/idyxqmdspq
@realdonaldtrump drug prices declined in 2018, the first time in nearly half a century. during the first 19 months of my administration, americans saved $26 billion on prescription drugs. our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working!
@realdonaldtrump i look forward to hosting, right out of the great state of south carolina, the 2019 ncaa football champion clemson tigers at the white house on monday, january 14th. what a game, what a coach, what a team!
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media keeps saying we havenâ€™t built any new wall. below is a section just completed on the border. anti-climbing feature included. very high, strong and beautiful! also, many miles already renovated and in service! pic.twitter.com/uaagxl5byr
@realdonaldtrump ...the steel barrier, or wall, should have been built by previous administrations long ago. they never got it done - i will. without it, our country cannot be safe. criminals, gangs, human traffickers, drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. it can be stopped cold!
@realdonaldtrump humanitarian crisis at our southern border. i just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand, an invasion! i have been there numerous times - the democrats, cryinâ€™ chuck and nancy donâ€™t know how bad and dangerous it is for our entire country....
@realdonaldtrump h1-b holders in the united states can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship. we want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the u.s.
@realdonaldtrump i often said during rallies, with little variation, that â€śmexico will pay for the wall.â€ť we have just signed a great new trade deal with mexico. it is billions of dollars a year better than the very bad nafta deal which it replaces. the difference pays for wall many times over!
@realdonaldtrump when i took the oath of office.... pic.twitter.com/gdhiqtekpv
@realdonaldtrump we lose 300 americans a week, 90% of which comes through the southern border. these numbers will be drastically reduced if we have a wall!
@realdonaldtrump will be interviewed at the border by @seanhannity on @foxnews tonight at 9:00. enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump dear diary... https://twitter.com/acosta/status/1083440238075236353â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump we have a massive humanitarian crisis at our southern border. we will be out for a long time unless the democrats come back from their â€śvacationsâ€ť and get back to work. i am in the white house ready to sign!
@realdonaldtrump ....i do have a plan on the shutdown. but to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that i won the election, and i promised safety and security for the american people. part of that promise was a wall at the southern border. elections have consequences!
@realdonaldtrump i just watched a fake reporter from the amazon washington post say the white house is â€śchaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this shutdown. there is no plan.â€ť the fakes always like talking chaos, there is none. in fact, thereâ€™s almost nobody in the w.h. but me, and...
@realdonaldtrump democrats could solve the shutdown in 15 minutes! call your demonstrative senator or congresswoman/man. tell them to get it done! humanitarian crisis.
@realdonaldtrump 23% of federal inmates are illegal immigrants. border arrests are up 240%. in the great state of texas, between 2011 & 2018, there were a total of 292,000 crimes by illegal aliens, 539 murders, 32,000 assaults, 3,426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. democrats come back!
@realdonaldtrump democrats should come back to washington and work to end the shutdown, while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our southern border. i am in the white house waiting for you!
@realdonaldtrump lyinâ€™ james comey, andrew mccabe, peter s and his lover, agent lisa page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. these are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your president. part of the witch hunt. remember the â€śinsurance policy?â€ť this is it!
@realdonaldtrump i have been far tougher on russia than obama, bush or clinton. maybe tougher than any other president. at the same time, & as i have often said, getting along with russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. i fully expect that someday we will have good relations with russia again!
@realdonaldtrump .....who is being totally protected by his best friend, bob mueller, & the 13 angry democrats - leaking machines who have no interest in going after the real collusion (and much more) by crooked hillary clinton, her campaign, and the democratic national committee. just watch!
@realdonaldtrump ....the fbi was in complete turmoil (see n.y. post) because of comeyâ€™s poor leadership and the way he handled the clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the justice department). my firing of james comey was a great day for america. he was a crooked cop......
@realdonaldtrump ...funny thing about james comey. everybody wanted him fired, republican and democrat alike. after the rigged & botched crooked hillary investigation, where she was interviewed on july fourth weekend, not recorded or sworn in, and where she said she didnâ€™t know anything (a lie),....
@realdonaldtrump wow, just learned in the failing new york times that the corrupt former leaders of the fbi, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after i fired lyinâ€™ james comey, a total sleaze!
@realdonaldtrump ....likewise, do not want the kurds to provoke turkey. russia, iran and syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term u.s. policy of destroying isis in syria - natural enemies. we also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. stop the endless wars!
@realdonaldtrump starting the long overdue pullout from syria while hitting the little remaining isis territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. will devastate turkey economically if they hit kurds. create 20 mile safe zone....
@realdonaldtrump wish i could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the white house and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and rose garden. really is something - special country, special place!
@realdonaldtrump thousands of illegal aliens who have committed sexual crimes against children are right now in texas prisons. most came through our southern border. we can end this easily - we need a steel barrier or wall. walls work! john jones, texas department of public safety. @foxnews
@realdonaldtrump the damage done to our country from a badly broken border - drugs, crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a shutdown, which the dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to washington!
@realdonaldtrump iâ€™m in the white house, waiting. the democrats are everywhere but washington as people await their pay. they are having fun and not even talking!
@realdonaldtrump the building of the wall on the southern border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire country!
@realdonaldtrump democrats are saying that daca is not worth it and donâ€™t want to include in talks. many hispanics will be coming over to the republican side, watch!
@realdonaldtrump i will be interviewed by jeanine pirro at 9:00 p.m. on @foxnews. watch @jessebwatters before and @greggutfeld after. all terrific people. i am in the white house waiting for cryinâ€™ chuck and nancy to call so we can start helping our country both at the border and from within!
@realdonaldtrump ....i am doing exactly what i pledged to do, and what i was elected to do by the citizens of our great country. just as i promised, i am fighting for you!
@realdonaldtrump for decades, politicians promised to secure the border, fix our trade deals, bring back our factories, get tough on china, move the embassy to jerusalem, make nato pay their fair share, and so much else - only to do nothing (or worse)....
@realdonaldtrump spoke w/ president erdogan of turkey to advise where we stand on all matters including our last two weeks of success in fighting the remnants of isis, and 20 mile safe zone. also spoke about economic development between the u.s. & turkey - great potential to substantially expand!
@realdonaldtrump getting ready to go on stage at the #afbf100 in new orleans - packed house! i will try and match the great game played yesterday by the new orleans saints and their incredible qb, drew brees. people here are very excited by the team. going on stage now! https://twitter.com/farmbureau/status/1084835531572301829â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump the fake news gets crazier and more dishonest every single day. amazing to watch as certain people covering me, and the tremendous success of this administration, have truly gone mad! their fake reporting creates anger and disunity. take two weeks off and come back rested. chill!
@realdonaldtrump â€śdems in puerto rico as shutdown hits day 24.â€ť @foxandfriends
@realdonaldtrump nancy and cryinâ€™ chuck can end the shutdown in 15 minutes. at this point it has become their, and the democrats, fault!
@realdonaldtrump iâ€™ve been waiting all weekend. democrats must get to work now. border must be secured!
@realdonaldtrump â€śgas prices drop across the united states because president trump has deregulated energy and we are now producing a great deal more oil than ever before.â€ť @foxandfriends but this is bad news for russia, why would president trump do such a thing? thought he worked for kremlin?
@realdonaldtrump ....border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the united states, as we have known it, is going to cease to exist...and americans will not go gentle into that good night. patrick buchanan. the great people of our country demand proper border security now!
@realdonaldtrump the trump portrait of an unsustainable border crisis is dead on. â€śin the last two years, ice officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes & 4000 violent killings.â€ť americaâ€™s southern....
@realdonaldtrump best line in the elizabeth warren beer catastrophe is, to her husband, â€śthank you for being here. iâ€™m glad youâ€™re hereâ€ť itâ€™s their house, heâ€™s supposed to be there!
@realdonaldtrump if elizabeth warren, often referred to by me as pocahontas, did this commercial from bighorn or wounded knee instead of her kitchen, with her husband dressed in full indian garb, it would have been a smash! pic.twitter.com/d5kwr8epan
@realdonaldtrump so sorry to hear the news about jeff bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, i understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the amazon washington post. hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!
@realdonaldtrump great being with the national champion clemson tigers last night at the white house. because of the shutdown i served them massive amounts of fast food (i paid), over 1000 hamburgers etcetera. within one hour, it was all gone. great guys and big eaters!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations @clemsonfb! pic.twitter.com/w8viax0owy
@realdonaldtrump why is nancy pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not?
@realdonaldtrump polls are now showing that people are beginning to understand the humanitarian crisis and crime at the border. numbers are going up fast, over 50%. democrats will soon be known as the party of crime. ridiculous that they donâ€™t want border security!
@realdonaldtrump a big new caravan is heading up to our southern border from honduras. tell nancy and chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. only a wall will work. only a wall, or steel barrier, will keep our country safe! stop playing political games and end the shutdown!
@realdonaldtrump volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in chattanooga, tennessee. they will be making electric cars. congratulations to chattanooga and tennessee on a job well done. a big win!
@realdonaldtrump just announced that veterans unemployment has reached an 18 year low, really good news for our vets and their families. will soon be an all time low! do you think the media will report on this and all of the other great economic news?
@realdonaldtrump the rank and file of the fbi are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about lyinâ€™ james comey and the so-called â€śleadersâ€ť of the fbi. twelve have been fired or forced to leave. they got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. bad!
@realdonaldtrump it is becoming more and more obvious that the radical democrats are a party of open borders and crime. they want nothing to do with the major humanitarian crisis on our southern border. #2020!
@realdonaldtrump there are now 77 major or significant walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building walls. over 800 miles of walls have been built in europe since only 2015. they have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. stop the crime at our southern border!
@realdonaldtrump so funny to watch schumer groveling. he called for the firing of bad cop james comey many times - until i fired him!
@realdonaldtrump the left has become totally unhinged. they no longer care what is right for our countrty!
@realdonaldtrump i will be making a major announcement concerning the humanitarian crisis on our southern border, and the shutdown, tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m., live from the @whitehouse.
@realdonaldtrump america first!
@realdonaldtrump make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump never seen the republican party so unified. no â€ścaveâ€ť on the issue of border and national security. a beautiful thing to see, especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the democrats who talk open border, high taxes and crime. stop criminals & drugs now!
@realdonaldtrump kevin corke, @foxnews â€śdonâ€™t forget, michael cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the wall street journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....â€ť lying to reduce his jail time! watch father-in-law!
@realdonaldtrump another big caravan heading our way. very hard to stop without a wall!
@realdonaldtrump â€śitâ€™s the democrats keeping everything closed.â€ť @jiminhofe so true!
@realdonaldtrump why would nancy pelosi leave the country with other democrats on a seven day excursion when 800,000 great people are not getting paid. also, could somebody please explain to nancy & her â€śbig donorsâ€ť in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in!
@realdonaldtrump border rancher: â€śweâ€™ve found prayer rugs out here. itâ€™s unreal.â€ť washington examiner people coming across the southern border from many countries, some of which would be a big surprise.
@realdonaldtrump gregg jarrett: â€śmuellerâ€™s prosecutors knew the â€śdossierâ€ť was the product of bias and deception.â€ť it was a fake, just like so much news coverage in our country. nothing but a witch hunt, from beginning to end!
@realdonaldtrump â€śin 2018 alone, 20,000 illegal aliens with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the border, and there was a 122% increase in fentanyl being smuggled between ports of entry. last month alone, more than 20,000 minors were smuggled into the u.s.â€ť @seanhannity
@realdonaldtrump thank you to amy kremer, women for trump co-founder, for doing such a great interview with martha maccallum...and by the way, women have the lowest unemployment numbers in many decades - at the highest pay ever. proud of that!
@realdonaldtrump i will be live from the white house at 4:00 p.m.
@realdonaldtrump mexico is doing nothing to stop the caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the united states. we stopped the last two - many are still in mexico but canâ€™t get through our wall, but it takes a lot of border agents if there is no wall. not easy!
@realdonaldtrump many people are saying that the mainstream media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up), as highlighted by the disgraceful buzzfeed story & the even more disgraceful coverage!
@realdonaldtrump the economy is one of the best in our history, with unemployment at a 50 year low, and the stock market ready to again break a record (set by us many times) - & all you heard yesterday, based on a phony story, was impeachment. you want to see a stock market crash, impeach trump!
@realdonaldtrump .@newtgingrich just stated that there has been no president since abraham lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite president, me! at the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office!
@realdonaldtrump will be leaving for dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our country!
@realdonaldtrump fake news is truly the enemy of the people!
@realdonaldtrump remember it was buzzfeed that released the totally discredited â€śdossier,â€ť paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats (as opposition research), on which the entire russian probe is based! a very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our country!
@realdonaldtrump just a son who loves his dad. nice! https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/971870502204727298â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump the media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with north korea. think of where we were at the end of the obama administration compared to now. great meeting this week with top reps. looking forward to meeting with chairman kim at end of february!
@realdonaldtrump thank you david! https://twitter.com/davidwohl/status/1086461107244490752â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump donâ€™t forget, we are building and renovating big sections of wall right now. moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. building, after all, is what i do best, even when money is not readily available!
@realdonaldtrump wow, just heard that my poll numbers with hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. that is because they know the border issue better than anyone, and they want security, which can only be gotten with a wall.
@realdonaldtrump nancy, i am still thinking about the state of the union speech, there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the shutdown, security is no problem), and my written acceptance. while a contract is a contract, iâ€™ll get back to you soon!
@realdonaldtrump nancy pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a radical democrat. she is so petrified of the â€śleftiesâ€ť in her party that she has lost control...and by the way, clean up the streets in san francisco, they are disgusting!
@realdonaldtrump no, amnesty is not a part of my offer. it is a 3 year extension of daca. amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful nancy!
@realdonaldtrump nancy pelosi and some of the democrats turned down my offer yesterday before i even got up to speak. they donâ€™t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. best economy! they should do the right thing for the country & allow people to go back to work.
@realdonaldtrump be careful and try staying in your house. large parts of the country are suffering from tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. amazing how big this system is. wouldnâ€™t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned global warming right now!
@realdonaldtrump always heard that as president, â€śitâ€™s all about the economy!â€ť well, we have one of the best economies in the history of our country. big gdp, lowest unemployment, companies coming back to the u.s. in big numbers, great new trade deals happening, & more. but little media mention!
@realdonaldtrump democrats are kidding themselves (they donâ€™t really believe it!) if they say you can stop crime, drugs, human trafficking and caravans without a wall or steel barrier. stop playing games and give america the security it deserves. a humanitarian crisis!
@realdonaldtrump four people in nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our country. 26 people killed on the border in a drug and gang related fight. two large caravans from honduras broke into mexico and are headed our way. we need a powerful wall!
@realdonaldtrump if nancy pelosi thinks that walls are â€śimmoral,â€ť why isnâ€™t she requesting that we take down all of the existing walls between the u.s. and mexico, even the new ones just built in san diego at their very strong urging. let millions of unchecked â€śstrangersâ€ť just flow into the u.s.
@realdonaldtrump china posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to u.s. trade tensions and new policies. makes so much sense for china to finally do a real deal, and stop playing around!

@realdonaldtrump last year was the best year for american manufacturing job growth since 1997, or 21 years. the previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the u.s., â€śyou would need a magic wand.â€ť i guess i found the magic wand - and it is only getting better!

@realdonaldtrump former fbi top lawyer james baker just admitted involvement in fisa warrant and further admitted there were irregularities in the way the russia probe was handled. they relied heavily on the unverified trump â€śdossierâ€ť paid for by the dnc & clinton campaign, & funded through a...
@realdonaldtrump the reason sarah sanders does not go to the â€śpodiumâ€ť much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press. i told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! most will never cover us fairly & hence, the term, fake news!
@realdonaldtrump the united states has a great economic story to tell. number one in the world, by far!
@realdonaldtrump last time i went to davos, the fake news said i should not go there. this year, because of the shutdown, i decided not to go, and the fake news said i should be there. the fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!
@realdonaldtrump never seen @senatemajldr and republicans so united on an issue as they are on the humanitarian crisis & security on our southern border. if we create a wall or barrier which prevents criminals and drugs from flowing into our country, crime will go down by record numbers!
@realdonaldtrump marist/npr/pbs poll shows president trumpâ€™s approval rating among latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. thank you, working hard!
@realdonaldtrump fbi top lawyer confirms â€śunusual steps.â€ť they relied on the clinton campaignâ€™s fake & unverified â€śdossier,â€ť which is illegal. â€śthat has corrupted them. that has enabled them to gather evidence by unconstitutional means, and thatâ€™s what they did to the president.â€ť judge napolitano
@realdonaldtrump without a wall our country can never have border or national security. with a powerful wall or steel barrier, crime rates (and drugs) will go substantially down all over the u.s. the dems know this but want to play political games. must finally be done correctly. no cave!

@realdonaldtrump nick sandmann and the students of covington have become symbols of fake news and how evil it can be. they have captivated the attention of the world, and i know they will use it for the good - maybe even to bring people together. it started off unpleasant, but can end in a dream!
@realdonaldtrump looking like nick sandman & covington catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media. not good, but making big comeback! â€śnew footage shows that media was wrong about teenâ€™s encounter with native americanâ€ť @tuckercarlson

@realdonaldtrump deroy murdock, national review: â€śwe are now exporting oil, which is the first time in my lifetime - we are right now the largest producer of oil and gas. this is not good if youâ€™re vladimir putin where your chief export is oil. w.h. agent - not good for kremlin.â€ť @tuckercarlson

@realdonaldtrump nancy just said she â€śjust doesnâ€™t understand why?â€ť very simply, without a wall it all doesnâ€™t work. our country has a chance to greatly reduce crime, human trafficking, gangs and drugs. should have been done for decades. we will not cave!
@realdonaldtrump without a wall there cannot be safety and security at the border or for the u.s.a. build the wall and crime will fall!
@realdonaldtrump ...back home where they belong, no more rockets or mâ€™s being fired over japan or anywhere else and, most importantly, no nuclear testing. this is more than has ever been accomplished with north korea, and the fake news knows it. i expect another good meeting soon, much potential!
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media loves saying â€śso little happened at my first summit with kim jong un.â€ť wrong! after 40 years of doing nothing with north korea but being taken to the cleaners, & with a major war ready to start, in a short 15 months, relationships built, hostages & remains....
@realdonaldtrump so interesting that bad lawyer michael cohen, who sadly will not be testifying before congress, is using the lawyer of crooked hillary clinton to represent him - gee, how did that happen? remember july fourth weekend when crooked went before fbi & wasnâ€™t sworn in, no tape, nothing?
@realdonaldtrump the economy is doing great. more people working in u.s.a. today than at any time in our history. media barely covers! @foxandfriends
@realdonaldtrump â€śthis is everything fdr dreamed about, the new deal to put america back to work. think of lbj, he gave people food stamps & welfare. donald trumpâ€™s giving them a job. heâ€™s got a lot of good things to talk about. news stories do not accurately cover him, should correct.â€ť @dougwead
@realdonaldtrump a great new book just out, â€śgame of thorns,â€ť by doug wead, presidential historian and best selling author. the book covers the campaign of 2016, and what could be more exciting than that?

@realdonaldtrump as the shutdown was going on, nancy pelosi asked me to give the state of the union address. i agreed. she then changed her mind because of the shutdown, suggesting a later date. this is her prerogative - i will do the address when the shutdown is over. i am not looking for an....
@realdonaldtrump greatest witch hunt in the history of our country! no collusion! border coyotes, drug dealers and human traffickers are treated better. who alerted cnn to be there?
@realdonaldtrump a third rate conman who interviewed me many years ago for just a short period of time has been playing his biggest con of all on fake news cnn. michael dâ€™antonio, a broken down hack who knows nothing about me, goes on night after night telling made up trump stories. disgraceful!
@realdonaldtrump great earnings coming out of stock market. too bad media doesnâ€™t devote much time to this!
@realdonaldtrump â€śax falls quickly at buzzfeed and huffpost!â€ť headline, new york post. fake news and bad journalism have caused a big downturn. sadly, many others will follow. the people want the truth!

@realdonaldtrump â€śwe absolutely need a physical barrier or wall, whatever you want to call it. the president yesterday laid all that out. we need to do it all, including the wall. i provided the same information to the previous administration, & it was ignored.â€ť mark morgan, border chief for â€śoâ€ť!
@realdonaldtrump thank you to the republican national committee, (the rnc), who voted unanimously yesterday to support me in the upcoming 2020 election. considering that we have done more than any administration in the first two years, this should be easy. more great things now in the works!
@realdonaldtrump we have turned away, at great expense, two major caravans, but a big one has now formed and is coming. at least 8000 people! if we had a powerful wall, they wouldnâ€™t even try to make the long and dangerous journey. build the wall and crime will fall!
@realdonaldtrump 21 days goes very quickly. negotiations with democrats will start immediately. will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. the case for national security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the border & through dialogue. we will build the wall!
@realdonaldtrump â€śi like the fact that the president is making the case (border security & crime) to the american people. now we know where nancy pelosi, chuck schumer & the democrats stand, which is no border security. will be big 2020 issue.â€ť matt schlapp, chair, acu. bigger than anyone knows!
@realdonaldtrump if roger stone was indicted for lying to congress, what about the lying done by comey, brennan, clapper, lisa page & lover, baker and soooo many others? what about hillary to fbi and her 33,000 deleted emails? what about lisa & peterâ€™s deleted texts & wienerâ€™s laptop? much more!
@realdonaldtrump i wish people would read or listen to my words on the border wall. this was in no way a concession. it was taking care of millions of people who were getting badly hurt by the shutdown with the understanding that in 21 days, if no deal is done, itâ€™s off to the races!

@realdonaldtrump jens stoltenberg, nato secretary general, just stated that because of me nato has been able to raise far more money than ever before from its members after many years of decline. itâ€™s called burden sharing. also, more united. dems & fake news like to portray the opposite!
@realdonaldtrump we are not even into february and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. cost friday was $603,331,392. there are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our country. so ridiculous! dhs
@realdonaldtrump 58,000 non-citizens voted in texas, with 95,000 non-citizens registered to vote. these numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. all over the country, especially in california, voter fraud is rampant. must be stopped. strong voter id! @foxandfriends

@realdonaldtrump cbs reports that in the roger stone indictment, data was â€śreleased during the 2016 election to damage hillary clinton.â€ť oh really! what about the fake and unverified â€śdossier,â€ť a total phony conjob, that was paid for by crooked hillary to damage me and the trump campaign? what...
@realdonaldtrump â€śin the mediaâ€™s effort to destroy the president, they are actually destroying themselves. given all of the tremendous headwinds this president has faced, itâ€™s amazing he has accomplished so much.â€ť deroy murdock @foxandfriends i agree!
@realdonaldtrump howard schultz doesnâ€™t have the â€śgutsâ€ť to run for president! watched him on @60minutes last night and i agree with him that he is not the â€śsmartest person.â€ť besides, america already has that! i only hope that starbucks is still paying me their rent in trump tower!

@realdonaldtrump after all that i have done for the military, our great veterans, judges (99), justices (2), tax & regulation cuts, the economy, energy, trade & much more, does anybody really think i wonâ€™t build the wall? done more in first two years than any president! make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump never thought iâ€™d say this but i think @johnrobertsfox and @gillianhturner @foxnews have even less understanding of the wall negotiations than the folks at fake news cnn & nbc! look to final results! donâ€™t know how my poll numbers are so good, especially up 19% with hispanics?
@realdonaldtrump a low level staffer that i hardly knew named cliff sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction. he pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer. he signed a non-disclosure agreement. he is a mess!

@realdonaldtrump when i became president, isis was out of control in syria & running rampant. since then tremendous progress made, especially over last 5 weeks. caliphate will soon be destroyed, unthinkable two years ago. negotiating are proceeding well in afghanistan after 18 years of fighting..

@realdonaldtrump very sadly, murder cases in mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017, to 33,341. this is a big contributor to the humanitarian crisis taking place on our southern border and then spreading throughout our country. worse even than afghanistan. much caused by drugs. wall is being built!
@realdonaldtrump schumer and the democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with iran. they have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our country. iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and iran deal termination. dems put us in a bad place - but now good!

@realdonaldtrump republicans on the homeland security committee are wasting their time. democrats, despite all of the evidence, proof and caravans coming, are not going to give money to build the desperately needed wall. iâ€™ve got you covered. wall is already being built, i donâ€™t expect much help!

@realdonaldtrump lets just call them walls from now on and stop playing political games! a wall is a wall!
@realdonaldtrump large sections of wall have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. renovation of existing walls is also a very big part of the plan to finally, after many decades, properly secure our border. the wall is getting done one way or the other!

@realdonaldtrump i inherited a total mess in syria and afghanistan, the â€śendless warsâ€ť of unlimited spending and death. during my campaign i said, very strongly, that these wars must finally end. we spend $50 billion a year in afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace...

@realdonaldtrump just out: the big deal, very mysterious don junior telephone calls, after the innocent trump tower meeting, that the media & dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found not to be made to me. they were made to friends & business associates of don. really sad!

@realdonaldtrump i think it is very important for the democrats to press forward with their green new deal. it would be great for the so-called â€ścarbon footprintâ€ť to permanently eliminate all planes, cars, cows, oil, gas & the military - even if no other country would do the same. brilliant!
@realdonaldtrump today elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to by me as pocahontas, joined the race for president. will she run as our first native american presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? see you on the campaign trail, liz!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats just donâ€™t seem to want border security. they are fighting border agents recommendations. if you believe news reports, they are not offering much for the wall. they look to be making this a campaign issue. the wall will get built one way or the other!
@realdonaldtrump we have a great economy despite the obama administration and all of its job killing regulations and roadblocks. if that thinking prevailed in the 2016 election, the u.s. would be in a depression right now! we were heading down, and donâ€™t let the democrats sound bites fool you!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats in congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. when the republicans had the majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! the dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!

@realdonaldtrump north korea, under the leadership of kim jong un, will become a great economic powerhouse. he may surprise some but he wonâ€™t surprise me, because i have gotten to know him & fully understand how capable he is. north korea will become a different kind of rocket - an economic one!

@realdonaldtrump the border committee democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed wall (they overrode recommendations of border patrol experts), but they donâ€™t even want to take muderers into custody! whatâ€™s going on?
@realdonaldtrump â€śpresident is on sound legal ground to declare a national emergency. there have been 58 national emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.â€ť congressman @tommcclintock
@realdonaldtrump ....the fact is, when i took over as president, our country was a mess. depleted military, endless wars, a potential war with north korea, v.a., high taxes & too many regulations, border, immigration & healthcare problems, & much more. i had no choice but to work very long hours!
@realdonaldtrump the media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. when the term executive time is used, i am generally working, not relaxing. in fact, i probably work more hours than almost any past president.....
@realdonaldtrump it was a very bad week for the democrats, with the great economic numbers, the virginia disaster and the state of the union address. now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the border committee, i actually believe they want a shutdown. they want a new subject!
@realdonaldtrump i donâ€™t think the dems on the border committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. they are offering very little money for the desperately needed border wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!
@realdonaldtrump gallup poll: â€śopen borders will potentially attract 42 million latin americans.â€ť this would be a disaster for the u.s. we need the wall now!

@realdonaldtrump disgraced fbi acting director andrew mccabe pretends to be a â€śpoor little angelâ€ť when in fact he was a big part of the crooked hillary scandal & the russia hoax - a puppet for leakinâ€™ james comey. i.g. report on mccabe was devastating. part of â€śinsurance policyâ€ť in case i won....
@realdonaldtrump california has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars. they owe the federal government three and a half billion dollars. we want that money back now. whole project is a â€śgreenâ€ť disaster!

@realdonaldtrump the united states is asking britain, france, germany and other european allies to take back over 800 isis fighters that we captured in syria and put them on trial. the caliphate is ready to fall. the alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them........

@realdonaldtrump .....this should never happen to a president again!
@realdonaldtrump ....should never have been appointed and there should be no mueller report. this was an illegal & conflicted investigation in search of a crime. russian collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the democrats for losing an election that they thought they were going to win.....
@realdonaldtrump so, if there was knowingly & acknowledged to be â€śzeroâ€ť crime when the special counsel was appointed, and if the appointment was made based on the fake dossier (paid for by crooked hillary) and now disgraced andrew mccabe (he & all stated no crime), then the special counsel.......

@realdonaldtrump those republican senators who voted in favor of strong border security (and the wall) are being uniformly praised as they return to their states. they know there is a national emergency at the southern border, and they had the courage to act. great job!

@realdonaldtrump ....just the large states - the cities would end up running the country. smaller states & the entire midwest would end up losing all power - & we canâ€™t let that happen. i used to like the idea of the popular vote, but now realize the electoral college is far better for the u.s.a.
@realdonaldtrump campaigning for the popular vote is much easier & different than campaigning for the electoral college. itâ€™s like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. the brilliance of the electoral college is that you must go to many states to win. with the popular vote, you go to....

@realdonaldtrump we have a national emergency at our southern border. the dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. would immediately solve the problem! mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the world, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs!

@realdonaldtrump so funny that the new york times & the washington post got a pulitzer prize for their coverage (100% negative and fake!) of collusion with russia - and there was no collusion! so, they were either duped or corrupt? in any event, their prizes should be taken away by the committee!
@realdonaldtrump ...the problem is, no matter what the radical left democrats get, no matter what we give them, it will never be enough. just watch, they will harass & complain & resist (the theme of their movement). so maybe we should just take our victory and say no, weâ€™ve got a country to run!
@realdonaldtrump robert mueller was a hero to the radical left democrats, until he ruled that there was no collusion with russia (so ridiculous to even say!). after more than two years since the â€śinsurance policyâ€ť statement was made by a dirty cop, i got the answers i wanted, the truth.....
@realdonaldtrump had the fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% gdp, & stock market, would have both been much higher & world markets would be in a better place!

@realdonaldtrump ....through their country and our southern border. mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the u.s., far greater than border costs. if mexico doesnâ€™t immediately stop all illegal immigration coming into the united states throug our southern border, i will be closing.....
@realdonaldtrump the democrats have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the world. mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 billion a year on the u.s. therefore, congress must change our weak immigration laws now, & mexico must stop illegals from entering the u.s....

@realdonaldtrump it would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid democrat inspired immigration laws. in less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved. but the dems donâ€™t care about the crime, they donâ€™t want any victory for trump and the republicans, even if good for usa!

@realdonaldtrump the crazed and dishonest washington post again purposely got it wrong. mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at their southern border, before the long march up to the u.s. this is great and the way it should be. the big flow will stop.......

@realdonaldtrump we have redeployed 750 agents at the southern borderâ€™s specific ports of entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the united states. this will cause traffic & commercial delays until such time as mexico is able to use....

@realdonaldtrump i have not read the mueller report yet, even though i have every right to do so. only know the conclusions, and on the big one, no collusion. likewise, recommendations made to our great a.g. who found no obstruction. 13 angry trump hating dems (later brought to 18) given two.....

@realdonaldtrump pleased to report that the american tourist and tour guide that were abducted in uganda have been released. god bless them and their families!
@realdonaldtrump looks like bob muellerâ€™s team of 13 trump haters & angry democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the fake news media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt & dishonest mainstream media, they are a joke!

@realdonaldtrump everybody is now acknowledging that, right from the time i announced my run for president, i was 100% correct on the border. remember the heat i took? democrats should now get rid of the loopholes. the border is being fixed. mexico will not let people through!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats must end the loopholes on immigration. so easy to solve!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe underlying issue remains the same without a single american being indicted for collusion with russia, & that is a stunning end considering we were led to believe (fake news) that something much more dramatic would happen. why did people fall for this?â€ť @tuckercarlson molly h

@realdonaldtrump ....the radical left always seems to have an open borders, open arms policy â€“ so this should make them very happy!
@realdonaldtrump due to the fact that democrats are unwilling to change our very dangerous immigration laws, we are indeed, as reported, giving strong considerations to placing illegal immigrants in sanctuary cities only....
@realdonaldtrump even the democrats now say that our southern border is a crisis and a national emergency. hopefully, we will not be getting any more bad (outrageous) court decisions!
@realdonaldtrump â€śdemocrats donâ€™t like the results of the mueller report, so now theyâ€™re trying everything else.â€ť @repdougcollins they should stop wasting time and money and get back to real legislating, especially on the border!
@realdonaldtrump president obamaâ€™s top white house lawyer, gregory b. craig, was indicted yesterday on very serious charges. this is a really big story, but the fake news new york times didnâ€™t even put it on page one, rather page 16. @washingtonpost not much better, â€śtinyâ€ť page one. corrupt news!
@realdonaldtrump â€śi donâ€™t need to know any more. weâ€™re done, absolutely done, he (mueller) tried the case. thereâ€™s no collusion.â€ť @lindseygrahamsc @foxandfriends no matter what we do or give to the radical left, it will never be enough!
@realdonaldtrump jobless claims at 50 year low!
@realdonaldtrump i never offered pardons to homeland security officials, never ordered anyone to close our southern border (although i have the absolute right to do so, and may if mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our border), and am not â€śfrustrated.â€ť it is all fake & corrupt news!
@realdonaldtrump ....when i won the election in 2016, the @nytimes had to beg their fleeing subscribers for forgiveness in that they covered the election (and me) so badly. they didnâ€™t have a clue, it was pathetic. they even apologized to me. but now they are even worse, really corrupt reporting!
@realdonaldtrump the new york times sanctuary cities/immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact. they never call to check for truth. their sources often donâ€™t even exist, a fraud. they will lie & cheat anyway possible to make me look bad. in 6 years they will be gone........
@realdonaldtrump great playing by @tigerwoods (at the) @themasters. tomorrow will be a big and exciting day for golf and for sports. many fantastic players in the hunt. ratings gold - good luck to all!
@realdonaldtrump why should radical left democrats in congress have a right to retry and examine the $35,000,000 (two years in the making) no collusion mueller report, when the crime committed was by crooked hillary, the dnc and dirty cops? attorney general barr will make the decision!
@realdonaldtrump ....extraordinary growth, economic success and riches under the leadership of chairman kim. i look forward to the day, which could be soon, when nuclear weapons and sanctions can be removed, and then watching north korea become one of the most successful nations of the world!

@realdonaldtrump in new york state, democrats blocked a bill expanding college tuition for gold star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants. no wonder so many people are leaving n.y. very sad!
@realdonaldtrump another fake story on @nbcnews that i offered pardons to homeland securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. of course this is not true. mainstream media is corrupt and getting worse, if that is possible, every day!

@realdonaldtrump if the radical left democrats all of a sudden donâ€™t want the illegal migrants in their sanctuary cities (no more open arms), why should others be expected to take them into their communities? go home and come into our country legally and through a system of merit!

@realdonaldtrump if the fed had done its job properly, which it has not, the stock market would have been up 5000 to 10,000 additional points, and gdp would have been well over 4% instead of 3%...with almost no inflation. quantitative tightening was a killer, should have done the exact opposite!
@realdonaldtrump just out: the usa has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to sanctuary cities. we hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level, especially by the state of california, which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!
@realdonaldtrump democrats must change the immigration laws fast. if not, sanctuary cities must immediately act to take care of the illegal immigrants - and this includes gang members, drug dealers, human traffickers, and criminals of all shapes, sizes and kinds. change the laws now!
@realdonaldtrump ....so interesting to see the mayor of oakland and other sanctuary cities not want our currently â€śdetained immigrantsâ€ť after release due to the ridiculous court ordered 20 day rule. if they donâ€™t want to serve our nation by taking care of them, why should other cities & towns?
@realdonaldtrump god bless the people of france!

@realdonaldtrump saudi arabia and others in opec will more than make up the oil flow difference in our now full sanctions on iranian oil. iran is being given very bad advice by @johnkerry and people who helped him lead the u.s. into the very bad iran nuclear deal. big violation of logan act?

@realdonaldtrump the wall is being rapidly built! the economy is great! our country is respected again!
@realdonaldtrump .....but should be much higher than that if twitter wasnâ€™t playing their political games. no wonder congress wants to get involved - and they should. must be more, and fairer, companies to get out the word!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe best thing ever to happen to twitter is donald trump.â€ť @mariabartiromo so true, but they donâ€™t treat me well as a republican. very discriminatory, hard for people to sign on. constantly taking people off list. big complaints from many people. different names-over 100 m.....
@realdonaldtrump â€śharley davidson has struggled with tariffs with the eu, currently paying 31%. theyâ€™ve had to move production overseas to try and offset some of that tariff that theyâ€™ve been hit with which will rise to 66% in june of 2021.â€ť @mariabartiromo so unfair to u.s. we will reciprocate!
@realdonaldtrump ....dumb and sick. a really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse. cnn has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster. in fact, it rewarded chris cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot, despite his massive failure in the morning. only on cnn!
@realdonaldtrump sorry to say but @foxandfriends is by far the best of the morning political shows on television. it rightfully has by far the highest ratings, not even close. morning psycho (joe), who helped get me elected in 2016 by having me on (free) all the time, has nosedived, too angry...
@realdonaldtrump in the â€śold daysâ€ť if you were president and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism. remember, â€śitâ€™s the economy stupid.â€ť today i have, as president, perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the mainstream media, it means nothing. but it will!
@realdonaldtrump the radical left democrats, together with their leaders in the fake news media, have gone totally insane! i guess that means that the republican agenda is working. stay tuned for more!
@realdonaldtrump i will be going to green bay, wisconsin, for a really big rally on saturday evening. big crowd expected, much to talk about. make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump i wonder if the new york times will apologize to me a second time, as they did after the 2016 election. but this one will have to be a far bigger & better apology. on this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the enemy of the people!
@realdonaldtrump paul krugman, of the fake news new york times, has lost all credibility, as has the times itself, with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. he is obsessed with hatred, just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. he said market would crash, only record highs!

@realdonaldtrump rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez is correct, the va is not broken, it is doing great. but that is only because of the trump administration. we got veterans choice & accountability passed. â€śpresident trump deserves a lot of credit.â€ť daniel caldwell, concerned veterans of america
@realdonaldtrump i didnâ€™t call bob costa of the washington post, he called me (returned his call)! just more fake news.
@realdonaldtrump ....congress has no time to legislate, they only want to continue the witch hunt, which i have already won. they should start looking at the criminals who are already very well known to all. this was a rigged system - we will drain the swamp!
@realdonaldtrump no collusion, no obstruction - there has never been a president who has been more transparent. millions of pages of documents were given to the mueller angry dems, plus i allowed everyone to testify, including w.h. counsel. i didnâ€™t have to do this, but now they want more.....
@realdonaldtrump can anyone comprehend what a great job border patrol and law enforcement is doing on our southern border. so far this year they have apprehended 418,000 plus illegal immigrants, way up from last year. mexico is doing very little for us. dems in congress must act now!
@realdonaldtrump .....are there no â€śhigh crimes and misdemeanors,â€ť there are no crimes by me at all. all of the crimes were committed by crooked hillary, the dems, the dnc and dirty cops - and we caught them in the act! we waited for mueller and won, so now the dems look to congress as last hope!
@realdonaldtrump the mueller report, despite being written by angry democrats and trump haters, and with unlimited money behind it ($35,000,000), didnâ€™t lay a glove on me. i did nothing wrong. if the partisan dems ever tried to impeach, i would first head to the u.s. supreme court. not only......
@realdonaldtrump mexicoâ€™s soldiers recently pulled guns on our national guard soldiers, probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the border. better not happen again! we are now sending armed soldiers to the border. mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending & returning!
@realdonaldtrump a very big caravan of over 20,000 people started up through mexico. it has been reduced in size by mexico but is still coming. mexico must apprehend the remainder or we will be forced to close that section of the border & call up the military. the coyotes & cartels have weapons!

@realdonaldtrump welcome to the race sleepy joe. i only hope you have the intelligence, long in doubt, to wage a successful primary campaign. it will be nasty - you will be dealing with people who truly have some very sick & demented ideas. but if you make it, i will see you at the starting gate!
@realdonaldtrump .....despite the fact that the mueller report was â€ścomposedâ€ť by trump haters and angry democrats, who had unlimited funds and human resources, the end result was no collusion, no obstruction. amazing!
@realdonaldtrump ....mueller was not fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what i, and many others, say was an illegal investigation (there was no crime), headed by a trump hater who was highly conflicted, and a group of 18 very angry democrats. drain the swamp!
@realdonaldtrump as has been incorrectly reported by the fake news media, i never told then white house counsel don mcgahn to fire robert mueller, even though i had the legal right to do so. if i wanted to fire mueller, i didnâ€™t need mcgahn to do it, i could have done it myself. nevertheless,....

@realdonaldtrump bob mueller was a great hero to the radical left democrats. now that the mueller report is finished, with a finding of no collusion & no obstruction (based on a review of report by our highly respected a.g.), the dems are going around saying, â€śbob who, sorry, donâ€™t know the man.â€ť

@realdonaldtrump for 10 months, china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25% on 50 billion dollars of high tech, and 10% on 200 billion dollars of other goods. these payments are partially responsible for our great economic results. the 10% will go up to 25% on friday. 325 billions dollars....

@realdonaldtrump puerto rico has been given more money by congress for hurricane disaster relief, 91 billion dollars, than any state in the history of the u.s. as an example, florida got $12 billion & texas $39 billion for their monster hurricanes. now the democrats are saying no relief to......
@realdonaldtrump scott walker is 100% correct when he says that the republicans must wake up to the democrats state by state power grab. they play very dirty, actually, like never before. donâ€™t allow them to get away with what they are doing!

@realdonaldtrump also, there are â€śno high crimes & misdemeanors,â€ť no collusion, no conspiracy, no obstruction. all the crimes are on the other side, and thatâ€™s what the dems should be looking at, but they wonâ€™t. nevertheless, the tables are turning!

@realdonaldtrump the reason for the china pullback & attempted renegotiation of the trade deal is the sincere hope that they will be able to â€śnegotiateâ€ť with joe biden or one of the very weak democrats, and thereby continue to ripoff the united states (($500 billion a year)) for years to come....

@realdonaldtrump real estate developers in the 1980â€™s & 1990â€™s, more than 30 years ago, were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would, if one was actively building, show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. much was non monetary. sometimes considered â€śtax shelter,â€ť ......

@realdonaldtrump your all time favorite president got tired of waiting for china to help out and start buying from our farmers, the greatest anywhere in the world!
@realdonaldtrump build your products in the united states and there are no tariffs!
@realdonaldtrump ....if we bought 15 billion dollars of agriculture from our farmers, far more than china buys now, we would have more than 85 billion dollars left over for new infrastructure, healthcare, or anything else. china would greatly slow down, and we would automatically speed up!
@realdonaldtrump the average 401(k) balance has soared since the bottom of the market - 466%. wow!
@realdonaldtrump tariffs will make our country much stronger, not weaker. just sit back and watch! in the meantime, china should not renegotiate deals with the u.s. at the last minute. this is not the obama administration, or the administration of sleepy joe, who let china get away with â€śmurder!â€ť
@realdonaldtrump tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. also, much easier & quicker to do. our farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. waivers on some products will be granted, or go to new source!
@realdonaldtrump ....agricultural products from our great farmers, in larger amounts than china ever did, and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance. in the meantime we will continue to negotiate with china in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!
@realdonaldtrump ....the process has begun to place additional tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 billion dollars. the u.s. only sells china approximately 100 billion dollars of goods & products, a very big imbalance. with the over 100 billion dollars in tariffs that we take in, we will buy.....
@realdonaldtrump talks with china continue in a very congenial manner - there is absolutely no need to rush - as tariffs are now being paid to the united states by china of 25% on 250 billion dollars worth of goods & products. these massive payments go directly to the treasury of the u.s....

@realdonaldtrump james comey is a disgrace to the fbi & will go down as the worst director in its long and once proud history. he brought the fbi down, almost all republicans & democrats thought he should be fired, but the fbi will regain greatness because of the great men & women who work there!
@realdonaldtrump i was not going to fire bob mueller, and did not fire bob mueller. in fact, he was allowed to finish his report with unprecedented help from the trump administration. actually, lawyer don mcgahn had a much better chance of being fired than mueller. never a big fan!
@realdonaldtrump ....the only problem is that they know i am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in u.s. history, & much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting big tariffs!
@realdonaldtrump i think that china felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky & have a democrat win - in which case they would continue to rip-off the usa for $500 billion a year....
@realdonaldtrump so now the radical left dems donâ€™t talk about collusion anymore, because the mueller report said there was no collusion, they only want to talk about obstruction, even though there was no obstruction or no crime - except for the crimes committed by the other side!
@realdonaldtrump i won the 2016 election partially based on no tax returns while i am under audit (which i still am), and the voters didnâ€™t care. now the radical left democrats want to again relitigate this matter. make it a part of the 2020 election!
@realdonaldtrump such an easy way to avoid tariffs? make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa. itâ€™s very simple!
@realdonaldtrump china is dreaming that sleepy joe biden, or any of the others, gets elected in 2020. they love ripping off america!
@realdonaldtrump the â€śconstitutional crisisâ€ť is the democrats refusing to work. let them start by fixing the mess that their immigration laws have caused at the southern border.
@realdonaldtrump when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia (of course), it was supposed to be over, back to work for the people. but the dems have gone â€śnuts,â€ť and it has actually gotten worse! hope the republicans win back the house in 2020, or little will get done!
@realdonaldtrump ever since the mueller report showed no collusion & no obstruction, the dems have been working overtime to damage me and the republican party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies, and with no reason. thatâ€™s all they want to do - donâ€™t care about anything else!
@realdonaldtrump despite two years and millions of dollars spent, the democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the mueller report were made public. but they knew there was nothing even before the report was started. it is all a big hoax, the biggest in american history!
@realdonaldtrump ....employment numbers ever, low taxes & regulations, a rebuilt military & v.a., many great new judges, & so much more. but we have had a giant scam perpetrated upon our nation, a witch hunt, a treasonous hoax. that is the constitutional crisis & hopefully guilty people will pay!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a â€śconstitutional crisis.â€ť they and their partner, the fake news media, are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible. they are a sad joke! we may have the strongest economy in our history, best...
@realdonaldtrump ....we will then spend (match or better) the money that china may no longer be spending with our great patriot farmers (agriculture), which is a small percentage of total tariffs received, and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! great! #maga
@realdonaldtrump we are right where we want to be with china. remember, they broke the deal with us & tried to renegotiate. we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china. buyers of product can make it themselves in the usa (ideal), or buy it from non-tariffed countries...

@realdonaldtrump ...completely avoided if you buy from a non-tariffed country, or you buy the product inside the usa (the best idea). thatâ€™s zero tariffs. many tariffed companies will be leaving china for vietnam and other such countries in asia. thatâ€™s why china wants to make a deal so badly!...
@realdonaldtrump there is no reason for the u.s. consumer to pay the tariffs, which take effect on china today. this has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the u.s., 21 points by china because china subsidizes product to such a large degree. also, the tariffs can be.....

@realdonaldtrump with all of the fake and made up news out there, iran can have no idea what is actually going on!
@realdonaldtrump it now seems the general flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge. it would have been impossible for me to know this but, if that was the case, and with me being one of two people who would become president, why was i not told so that i could make a change?
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media is hurting our country with its fraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of iran. it is scattershot, poorly sourced (made up), and dangerous. at least iran doesnâ€™t know what to think, which at this point may very well be a good thing!
@realdonaldtrump will jerry nadler ever look into the fact that crooked hillary deleted and acid washed 33,000 emails after getting a most powerful demand notice for them from congress?
@realdonaldtrump my campaign for president was conclusively spied on. nothing like this has ever happened in american politics. a really bad situation. treason means long jail sentences, and this was treason!

@realdonaldtrump border patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the southern border. the bad â€śhombres,â€ť of which there are many, are being detained & will be sent home. those which we release under the ridiculous catch & telease loophole, are being registered and will be removed later!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats now realize that there is a national emergency at the border and that, if we work together, it can be immediately fixed. we need democrat votes and all will be well!

@realdonaldtrump hard to believe that @foxnews is wasting airtime on mayor pete, as chris wallace likes to call him. fox is moving more and more to the losing (wrong) side in covering the dems. they got dumped from the democrats boring debates, and they just want in. they forgot the people.....

@realdonaldtrump never a fan of @justinamash, a total lightweight who opposes me and some of our great republican ideas and policies just for the sake of getting his name out there through controversy. if he actually read the biased mueller report, â€ścomposedâ€ť by 18 angry dems who hated trump,....

@realdonaldtrump ....now the new big story is that trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash, he doesnâ€™t need banks. but where did he get all of that cash? could it be russia? no, i built a great business and donâ€™t need banks, but if i did they would be there...and deutschebank......
@realdonaldtrump the mainstream media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today. fake news is actually the biggest story of all and is the true enemy of the people! thatâ€™s why they refuse to cover the real russia hoax. but the american people are wise to what is going on.....
@realdonaldtrump ....fashioned, but true. when you donâ€™t need or want money, you donâ€™t need or want banks. banks have always been available to me, they want to make money. fake media only says this to disparage, and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources donâ€™t even exist)......
@realdonaldtrump the failing new york times (it will pass away when i leave office in 6 years), and others of the fake news media, keep writing phony stories about how i didnâ€™t use many banks because they didnâ€™t want to do business with me. wrong! it is because i didnâ€™t need money. very old

@realdonaldtrump ....but they really want a do-over! you canâ€™t investigate and legislate simultaneously - it just doesnâ€™t work that way. you canâ€™t go down two tracks at the same time. let chuck, nancy, jerry, adam and all of the rest finish playing their games....
@realdonaldtrump so sad that nancy pelosi and chuck schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our country. they can continue the witch hunt which has already cost $40m and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in america, or get back to work....
@realdonaldtrump as i have long been saying, and has now been proven out, this is a witch hunt against the republican party and myself, and it was the other side that caused the problem, not us!
@realdonaldtrump "..between russia and the trump campaign. mr. mcgahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in mr. nadlerâ€™s pseudo-impeachment drama.â€ť wall street journal editorial board today - may 21, 2019"
@realdonaldtrump â€śhe (jerry nadler) wants a show. he wants to use mr. mcgahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that mr. trump tried to obstruct the mueller investigation. yet mr. mueller wasnâ€™t obstructed in any way, his copious report was released for all to see, & there was no collusion..
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases. they ought to start governing. you know, for a change.â€ť michael goodwin @newyorkpost
@realdonaldtrump everybody, including me, thought that when the 40 million dollar mueller report was released with no collusion and no obstruction (of a crime caused by others), that was the end. but no, the democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020. bad for the country!
@realdonaldtrump also, tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing walls that are in bad condition and ineffective, and bringing them to a very high standard!
@realdonaldtrump much of the wall being built at the southern border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new wall and footings. problem is, the haters say that is not a new wall, but rather a renovation. wrong, and we must build where most needed....
@realdonaldtrump without the illegal witch hunt, my poll numbers, especially because of our historically â€śgreatâ€ť economy, would be at 65%. too bad! the greatest hoax in american history.
@realdonaldtrump the democrats are getting zero work done in congress. all they are focused on is trying to prove the mueller report wrong, the witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump after two years of an expensive and comprehensive witch hunt, the democrats donâ€™t like the result and they want a do over. in other words, the witch hunt continues!
@realdonaldtrump everything the democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them, especially when the mueller report came back with a no collusion finding. now they say impeach president trump, even though he did nothin wrong, while they â€śfish!â€ť
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to governor @mattbevin on winning the republican primary for governor tonight in the great state of kentucky. matt, you are doing a fantastic job!

@realdonaldtrump john brennan on the mueller probe, â€śi donâ€™t know if i received bad information, but i think i suspected that there was more than there actually was.â€ť wow, he admits he was wrong! congress should go back to work on drug prices etcetera.
@realdonaldtrump the democrats are on a fishing expedition, wanting to interview the same people, and see the same things, as we just went through for two years with robert mueller and the 18 angry dems. never happened to a president before. never even happened to president obama!
@realdonaldtrump after spending 40 million dollars, reviewing 1.4 million pages of documents, & interviewing 500 people with the total support of the white house, the mueller report was a big disappointment to the democrats, so they want a do over. it doesnâ€™t work that way-so bad for our country!

@realdonaldtrump i was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with pelosi and schumer, knowing that they would say i was raging, which they always do, along with their partner, the fake news media. well, so many stories about the meeting use the rage narrative anyway - fake & corrupt press!
@realdonaldtrump rex tillerson, a man who is â€śdumb as a rockâ€ť and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be secretary of state, made up a story (he got fired) that i was out-prepared by vladimir putin at a meeting in hamburg, germany. i donâ€™t think putin would agree. look how the u.s. is doing!

@realdonaldtrump the democrats are getting nothing done in congress. all of their effort is about a re-do of the mueller report, which didnâ€™t turn out the way they wanted. it is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time. their heart is not into infrastructure, lower.....

@realdonaldtrump in a letter to her house colleagues, nancy pelosi said: â€śpresident trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see.â€ť this is not true. i was purposely very polite and calm, much as i was minutes later with the press in the rose garden. can be easily proven. it is all such a lie!
@realdonaldtrump .....the dems want a second shot at bob mueller, are very unhappy with the no collusion report. they should not be allowed to play this game any longer - no second chances - must get back to work. so bad for our country!

@realdonaldtrump â€śif they try to impeach president trump, who has done nothing wrong (no collusion), they will end up getting him re-electedâ€ť @lindseygrahamsc impeachment is for high crimes and misdemeanors. there were no high crimes and misdemeanors, except for those committed by the other side!

@realdonaldtrump if president obama made the deals that i have made, both at the border and for the economy, the corrupt media would be hailing them as incredible, & a national holiday would be immediately declared. with me, despite our record setting economy and all that i have done, no credit!
@realdonaldtrump twitter should let the banned conservative voices back onto their platform, without restriction. itâ€™s called freedom of speech, remember. you are making a giant mistake!
@realdonaldtrump .....there is not, we can always go back to our previous, very profitable, position of tariffs - but i donâ€™t believe that will be necessary. the failing @nytimes, & ratings challenged @cnn, will do anything possible to see our country fail! they are truly the enemy of the people!

@realdonaldtrump i know it is not at all â€śpresidentialâ€ť to hit back at the corrupt media, or people who work for the corrupt media, when they make false statements about me or the trump administration. problem is, if you donâ€™t hit back, people believe the fake news is true. so weâ€™ll hit back!

@realdonaldtrump ....we do not anticipate a problem with the vote but, if for any reason the approval is not forthcoming, tariffs will be reinstated!

@realdonaldtrump the dems are very unhappy with the mueller report, so after almost 3 years, they want a redo, or do over. this is extreme presidential harassment. they gave crooked hillaryâ€™s people complete immunity, yet now they bring back hope hicks. why arenâ€™t the dems looking at the.....

@realdonaldtrump donâ€™t ever forget - this election is about you. it is about your family, your future, & the fate of your country. we begin our campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, & the only positive vision for our countryâ€™s future! #trump2020 pic.twitter.com/vmu28hkqh6
@realdonaldtrump in the ultimate act of moral cowardice, not one democrat candidate for president - not a single one - has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ice and border patrol. they donâ€™t have the character, the virtue, or the spine! #trump2020 pic.twitter.com/oulnnvtxmw
@realdonaldtrump on no issue are democrats more extreme â€“ and more depraved â€“ than when it comes to border security. the democrat agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible. it is the great betrayal of the american middle class and our country as a whole! #trump2020 pic.twitter.com/f9rjhpp50j

@realdonaldtrump â€śthe president has a really good story to tell. we have unemployment lower than weâ€™ve seen in decades. we have people who stopped looking for work coming back into the labor force. we are in a record growth period.â€ť michael steel @msnbc (do you believe?)
@realdonaldtrump s&p opens at record high!
@realdonaldtrump since election day 2016, stocks up almost 50%, stocks gained 9.2 trillion dollars in value, and more than 5,000,000 new jobs added to the economy. @loudobbs if our opponent had won, there would have been a market crash, plain and simple! @tuckercarlson @seanhannity @ingrahamangle
@realdonaldtrump ....proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. i am in no hurry, our military is rebuilt, new, and ready to go, by far the best in the world. sanctions are biting & more added last night. iran can never have nuclear weapons, not against the usa, and not against the world!
@realdonaldtrump ....on monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in international waters. we were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when i asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a general. 10 minutes before the strike i stopped it, not....
@realdonaldtrump ....death to america. i terminated deal, which was not even ratified by congress, and imposed strong sanctions. they are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my presidency, when they were causing major problems throughout the middle east. now they are bust!....
@realdonaldtrump president obama made a desperate and terrible deal with iran - gave them 150 billion dollars plus i.8 billion dollars in cash! iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out. gave them a free path to nuclear weapons, and soon. instead of saying thank you, iran yelled.....
@realdonaldtrump ....â€ťthis russia collusion hoax was perpetrated in part by people inside the government, and in part by a compliant (fake news) media.â€ť mollie hemingway. @tuckercarlson @foxandfriends the facts are starting to pour out. stay tuned!
@realdonaldtrump just revealed that the failing and desperate new york times was feeding false stories about me, & those associated with me, to the fbi. this shows the kind of unprecedented hatred i have been putting up with for years with this crooked newspaper. is what they have done legal?...
@realdonaldtrump i never called the strike against iran â€śback,â€ť as people are incorrectly reporting, i just stopped it from going forward at this time!
@realdonaldtrump at the request of democrats, i have delayed the illegal immigration removal process (deportation) for two weeks to see if the democrats and republicans can get together and work out a solution to the asylum and loophole problems at the southern border. if not, deportations start!
@realdonaldtrump ....sanctions come off iran, and they become a productive and prosperous nation again - the sooner the better!
@realdonaldtrump iran cannot have nuclear weapons! under the terrible obama plan, they would have been on their way to nuclear in a short number of years, and existing verification is not acceptable. we are putting major additional sanctions on iran on monday. i look forward to the day that.....
@realdonaldtrump i am at camp david working on many things, including iran! we have a great economy, tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge dollars coming in, & on helping to make good trade deals. the dow heading to best june in 80 years! stock market best june in 50 years!

@realdonaldtrump when people come into our country illegally, they will be deported!
@realdonaldtrump the people that ice will apprehend have already been ordered to be deported. this means that they have run from the law and run from the courts. these are people that are supposed to go back to their home country. they broke the law by coming into the country, & now by staying.
@realdonaldtrump when our country had no debt and built everything from highways to the military with cash, we had a big system of tariffs. now we allow other countries to steal our wealth, treasure, and jobs - but no more! the usa is doing great, with unlimited upside into the future!
@realdonaldtrump wonderful church service at camp david. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump i want to give the democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to asylum and loopholes. this will fix the southern border, together with the help that mexico is now giving us. probably wonâ€™t happen, but worth a try. two weeks and big deportation begins!
@realdonaldtrump i am pleased to announce the launch of http://tmagac.winred.comâ . this new platform will allow my campaign and other republicans to compete with the democrats money machine. this has been a priority of mine and iâ€™m pleased to share that it is up and running! #keepamericagreat
@realdonaldtrump ....think of what it could have been if the fed had gotten it right. thousands of points higher on the dow, and gdp in the 4â€™s or even 5â€™s. now they stick, like a stubborn child, when we need rates cuts, & easing, to make up for what other countries are doing against us. blew it!
@realdonaldtrump despite a federal reserve that doesnâ€™t know what it is doing - raised rates far too fast (very low inflation, other parts of world slowing, lowering & easing) & did large scale tightening, $50 billion/month, we are on course to have one of the best months of june in us history...
@realdonaldtrump ....a dangerous journey. we donâ€™t even need to be there in that the u.s. has just become (by far) the largest producer of energy anywhere in the world! the u.s. request for iran is very simple - no nuclear weapons and no further sponsoring of terror!
@realdonaldtrump china gets 91% of its oil from the straight, japan 62%, & many other countries likewise. so why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation. all of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been....

@realdonaldtrump ....iranâ€™s very ignorant and insulting statement, put out today, only shows that they do not understand reality. any attack by iran on anything american will be met with great and overwhelming force. in some areas, overwhelming will mean obliteration. no more john kerry & obama!
@realdonaldtrump ....the wonderful iranian people are suffering, and for no reason at all. their leadership spends all of its money on terror, and little on anything else. the u.s. has not forgotten iranâ€™s use of iedâ€™s & efpâ€™s (bombs), which killed 2000 americans, and wounded many more...
@realdonaldtrump iran leadership doesnâ€™t understand the words â€śniceâ€ť or â€ścompassion,â€ť they never have. sadly, the thing they do understand is strength and power, and the usa is by far the most powerful military force in the world, with 1.5 trillion dollars invested over the last two years alone..

@realdonaldtrump the republican senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our southern border, 84-8! in addition to aid, congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the crisis. we must end incentives for smuggling children, trafficking women, and selling drugs.
@realdonaldtrump ....no collusion, no obstruction! robert mueller said he was done after his last 9 minute news conference, as later corrected. now the dems want to give it another try. does it ever end?
@realdonaldtrump according to fake news (and low ratings) @cnn, â€śdemocrats say hearings could change impeachment debate.â€ť thatâ€™s because they have lost the impeachment debate (80% say no), and they are hoping that yet another do over, after 2 1/2 years and $40,000,000, will turn things around....

@realdonaldtrump so interesting to see â€śprogressiveâ€ť democrat congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all), now loudly......
@realdonaldtrump a big risk of major flooding in large parts of louisiana and all across the gulf coast. please be very careful!

@realdonaldtrump the obama administration built the cages, not the trump administration! democrats must give us the votes to change bad immigration laws.

@realdonaldtrump â€śwe all know that aoc and this crowd are a bunch of communists, they hate israel, they hate our own country, theyâ€™re calling the guards along our border (the border patrol agents) concentration camp guards, they accuse people who support israel as doing it for the benjaminâ€™s,....
@realdonaldtrump if democrats want to unite around the foul language & racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular & unrepresentative congresswomen, it will be interesting to see how it plays out. i can tell you that they have made israel feel abandoned by the u.s.

@realdonaldtrump chinaâ€™s second quarter growth is the slowest it has been in more than 27 years. the united states tariffs are having a major effect on companies wanting to leave china for non-tariffed countries. thousands of companies are leaving. this is why china wants to make a deal....

@realdonaldtrump those tweets were not racist. i donâ€™t have a racist bone in my body! the so-called vote to be taken is a democrat con game. republicans should not show â€śweaknessâ€ť and fall into their trap. this should be a vote on the filthy language, statements and lies told by the democrat.....

@realdonaldtrump the washington post story, about my speech in north carolina and tweet, with its phony sources who do not exist, is fake news. the only thing people were talking about is the record setting crowd and the tremendous enthusiasm, far greater than the democrats. youâ€™ll see in 2020!

@realdonaldtrump it is far more costly for the federal reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does, in the future, turn down! very inexpensive, in fact productive, to move now. the fed raised & tightened far too much & too fast. in other words, they missed it (big!). donâ€™t miss it again!
@realdonaldtrump ....as we have done, it could have been soooo much better. interest rate costs should have been much lower, & gdp & our countryâ€™s wealth accumulation much higher. such a waste of time & money. also, very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in!

@realdonaldtrump the young leaders here today (@tpusa) are part of a movement unlike anything in the history of our nation. it is a movement about reclaiming your future, rebuilding your country, restoring your destiny, and renewing the values that are the true source of american greatness! pic.twitter.com/unurpls8lc

@realdonaldtrump president trumpâ€™s approval rating on economy is at 52%, a 4 point jump. fox poll @foxandfriends shouldnâ€™t this be at 100%? best stock market, economy and unemployment numbers ever! most people working within u.s. ever! low interest rates, very low inflation! country doing great!
@realdonaldtrump fox poll say best economy in decades!
@realdonaldtrump ...impeachment, you have a party of one. itâ€™s over.â€ť @kilmeade â€śnancy said, jerry, please sit down. very bad idea. we discovered that after putting so much time & energy into the mueller report, it turns out mueller didnâ€™t know what was in his report.â€ť @stevedoocy @foxandfriends
@realdonaldtrump â€śyesterday changed everything, it really did clear the president. he wins.â€ť @ainsleyearhardt â€śit changed everything in favor of the president, who said all along this investigation is rooted in nothing. mueller was exposed as being best friends with comey. today, you say.....

@realdonaldtrump .@foxnews is at it again. so different from what they used to be during the 2016 primaries, & before - proud warriors! now new fox polls, which have always been terrible to me (they had me losing big to crooked hillary), have me down to sleepy joe. even considering.....

@realdonaldtrump we gave nadler and his trump hating dems the complete mueller report (we didnâ€™t have to), and even mueller himself, but now that both were a total bust, they say it wasnâ€™t good enough. nothing will ever be good enough for them. witch hunt!
@realdonaldtrump elijah cummings spends all of his time trying to hurt innocent people through â€śoversight.â€ť he does nothing for his very poor, very dangerous and very badly run district! take a look.... #blacksfortrump2020 https://twitter.com/w_terrence/status/1155168907654774784â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump democrats donâ€™t care about border security. they refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the loopholes and asylum. would be so easy! they want open borders, which means crime,crime,crime!
@realdonaldtrump such a big victory of our country! â€śsupreme court approves trump administration plan to use military funds for the wall.â€ť @foxnews we will be fully reimbursed for this expenditure, over time, by other countries.
@realdonaldtrump the dems are now coming out of shock from the terrible mueller performance, and are starting to spin impeachment all over again. how sick & disgusting and bad for our country are they. what they are doing is so wrong, but they do it anyway. dems have become the do nothing party!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly & irrevocably tarnished witch hunt hoax until robert mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude & incompetence that the halls of congress have ever seen. truth is, he had no facts on his side. nothing he could do!
@realdonaldtrump consideration is being given to declaring antifa, the gutless radical left wack jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major organization of terror (along with ms-13 & others). would make it easier for police to do their job!
@realdonaldtrump why is so much money sent to the elijah cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the united states. no human being would want to live there. where is all this money going? how much is stolen? investigate this corrupt mess immediately!
@realdonaldtrump ....as proven last week during a congressional tour, the border is clean, efficient & well run, just very crowded. cumming district is a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess. if he spent more time in baltimore, maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place
@realdonaldtrump rep, elijah cummings has been a brutal bully, shouting and screaming at the great men & women of border patrol about conditions at the southern border, when actually his baltimore district is far worse and more dangerous. his district is considered the worst in the usa......

@realdonaldtrump under the trump administration, african american unemployment is the lowest (best) in the history of the united states. no president has come close to doing this before! i also created successful opportunity zones. waiting for nancy and elijah to say, â€śthank you, mr. president!â€ť
@realdonaldtrump if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district, and baltimore itself, perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. his radical â€śoversightâ€ť is a joke!
@realdonaldtrump there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of baltimore itself. dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. shame!
@realdonaldtrump â€śelijah cummings has had his chance to address it (crime & conditions in baltimore) for decades, and he hasnâ€™t gotten it done.â€ť @petehegseth @foxandfriends how can he get it done when he just wants to use his oversight committee to hurt innocent people and divide our country!
@realdonaldtrump speaking of failing badly, has anyone seen what is happening to nancy pelosiâ€™s district in san francisco. it is not even recognizeable lately. something must be done before it is too late. the dems should stop wasting time on the witch hunt hoax and start focusing on our country!
@realdonaldtrump ....a look, the facts speak far louder than words! the democrats always play the race card, when in fact they have done so little for our nationâ€™s great african american people. now, lowest unemployment in u.s. history, and only getting better. elijah cummings has failed badly!
@realdonaldtrump someone please explain to nancy pelosi, who was recently called racist by those in her own party, that there is nothing wrong with bringing out the very obvious fact that congressman elijah cummings has done a very poor job for his district and the city of baltimore. just take...

@realdonaldtrump the real collusion, the conspiracy, the crime, was between the clinton campaign, the dnc, fusion gps, christopher steele.....(and many others including comey, mccabe, lisa page and her lover, ohr and his wonderful wife, and on and on!). @replouiegohmert
@realdonaldtrump so sad that elijah cummings has been able to do so little for the people of baltimore. statistically, baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. cummings has done nothing but milk baltimore dry, but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!
@realdonaldtrump ....robert muellerâ€™s testimony, and the mueller report itself, was a disaster for this illegal democrat inspired witch hunt. it is an embarrassment to the usa that they donâ€™t know how to stop. they canâ€™t help themselves, they are totally lost, they are clowns!
@realdonaldtrump â€śone of the biggest things to come out of muellerâ€™s testimony was the fact that when he was asked, was there anything that impeded your investigation, the answer was a clear, unequivocal, no.â€ť misty marris @foxnews true, but many other great â€śexoneratingâ€ť things came out.....

@realdonaldtrump the fed â€śraisedâ€ť way too early and way too much. their quantitative tightening was another big mistake. while our country is doing very well, the potential wealth creation that was missed, especially when measured against our debt, is staggering. we are competing with other.....

@realdonaldtrump crazy bernie sanders recently equated the city of baltimore to a third world country! based on that statement, i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist, just as a republican would if he used that term and standard! the fact is, baltimore can be brought back, maybe......
@realdonaldtrump the e.u. and china will further lower interest rates and pump money into their systems, making it much easier for their manufacturers to sell product. in the meantime, and with very low inflation, our fed does nothing - and probably will do very little by comparison. too bad!
@realdonaldtrump al sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. he would say, â€śitâ€™s a personal favor to me.â€ť seldom, but sometimes, i would go. it was fine. he came to my office in t.t. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. just a conman at work!
@realdonaldtrump if the democrats are going to defend the radical left â€śsquadâ€ť and king elijahâ€™s baltimore fail, it will be a long road to 2020. the good news for the dems is that they have the fake news media in their pocket!

@realdonaldtrump things are going along very well with china. they are paying us tens of billions of dollars, made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going. so far our consumer is paying nothing - and no inflation. no help from fed!
@realdonaldtrump countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate real trade deals, not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations. they donâ€™t want to be targeted for tariffs by the u.s.

@realdonaldtrump china is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of billions of dollars they have been taking from the u.s. with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation. so one-sided, it should have been stopped many years ago!
@realdonaldtrump ....used currency manipulation to steal our businesses and factories, hurt our jobs, depress our workersâ€™ wages and harm our farmersâ€™ prices. not anymore!

@realdonaldtrump china dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. itâ€™s called â€ścurrency manipulation.â€ť are you listening federal reserve? this is a major violation which will greatly weaken china over time!

@realdonaldtrump wow! the deputy editor of the failing new york times was just demoted. should have been fired! totally biased and inaccurate reporting. the paper is a fraud, zero credibility. fake news takes another hit, but this time a big one!
@realdonaldtrump our great farmers know how important it is to win on trade. they will be the big winners!
@realdonaldtrump the united states is now, by far, the biggest, strongest and most powerful economy in the world, it is not even close! as others falter, we will only get stronger. consumers are in the best shape ever, plenty of cash. business optimism is at an all time high!
@realdonaldtrump if president xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the hong kong problem. i have no doubt! https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1161774305895694336â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump it would show great weakness if israel allowed rep. omar and rep.tlaib to visit. they hate israel & all jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. minnesota and michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. they are a disgrace!
@realdonaldtrump the philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets. he had a long and very dangerous criminal record. looked like he was having a good time after his capture, and after wounding so many police. long sentence - must get much tougher on street crime!
@realdonaldtrump ....what they were doing. thereâ€™s plenty of indication, we donâ€™t have to speculate.â€ť @stevedoocy â€śholy cow, got to read this book.â€ť @ainsleyearhardt â€śwow!â€ť @foxandfriends a very serious situation. can never be allowed to happen again! drain the swamp
@realdonaldtrump go out and get andrew mccarthyâ€™s new book, â€śball of collusion.â€ť â€śsupervision became the investigator, and when they pushed the envelope, there was nobody there to tell them no. it goes right to the president (obama). plenty of information that obama was informed & knew exactly...
@realdonaldtrump two great entertainers and, more importantly, great people! check out their show. https://twitter.com/diamondandsilk/status/1161827348276080641â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump having dinner tonight with timothy cook of apple. they will be spending vast sums of money in the u.s. great!
@realdonaldtrump just completed a very good meeting on afghanistan. many on the opposite side of this 19 year war, and us, are looking to make a deal - if possible!
@realdonaldtrump i donate 100% of my presidentâ€™s salary, $400,000, back to our country, and feel very good about it! https://twitter.com/juddpdeere45/status/1162445450273800192â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump like it or not, tlaib and omar are fast becoming the face of the democrat party. cortez (aoc) is fuming, not happy about this!
@realdonaldtrump rep. tlaib wrote a letter to israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. permission was quickly granted, whereupon tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. the only real winner here is tlaibâ€™s grandmother. she doesnâ€™t have to see her now!
@realdonaldtrump israel was very respectful & nice to rep. rashida tlaib, allowing her permission to visit her â€śgrandmother.â€ť as soon as she was granted permission, she grandstanded & loudly proclaimed she would not visit israel. could this possibly have been a setup? israel acted appropriately!
@realdonaldtrump senator jim risch of the great state of idaho has been an incredible supporter of our agenda! he is tough on crime, strong on borders, and will continue to fight for our second amendment. jim will never let you down. he has my full and complete endorsement!
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to patrick yoes for his election as national president of the great fraternal order of police. together we will fight for our incredible law enforcement officers!
@realdonaldtrump thank you to my good friend chuck canterbury for 16 years of service to the fraternal order of police and our great men and women in blue. you are an incredible patriot!

@realdonaldtrump major consideration is being given to naming antifa an â€śorganization of terror.â€ť portland is being watched very closely. hopefully the mayor will be able to properly do his job!
@realdonaldtrump biggest crowd ever, according to arena people. thousands outside trying to get in. place was packed! radical left dems & their partner, lamestream media, saying arena empty. check out pictures. fake news. the enemy of the people! https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1162195296924946433â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump look at the tremendous overflow at packed arena in new hampshire last night. sorry we couldnâ€™t get you in, will be back soon! pic.twitter.com/rvd2tejrpo
@realdonaldtrump great time in new hampshire last night. placed was maxed out, totally packed, with thousands coming to the arena floor at start. thousands more outside that were not allowed in per code. energy was really great to see. we will win new hampshire in 2020!
@realdonaldtrump the new york times will be out of business soon after i leave office, hopefully in 6 years. they have zero credibility and are losing a fortune, even now, especially after their massive unfunded liability. iâ€™m fairly certain theyâ€™ll endorse me just to keep it all going!
@realdonaldtrump thank you @tedcruz, i couldnâ€™t agree more! https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1163137145218973696â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump house democrats want to take action against israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it & the israeli people. dems have such disdain for israel! what happened? aoc plus 4 is the new face of the democrat party!
@realdonaldtrump our economy is the best in the world, by far. lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. import prices down, china eating tariffs. helping targeted farmers from big tariff money coming in. great future for usa!
@realdonaldtrump juan williams at @foxnews is so pathetic, and yet when he met me in the fox building lobby, he couldnâ€™t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. yet he is always nasty and wrong!
@realdonaldtrump we are doing very well with china, and talking!
@realdonaldtrump doing really well! https://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/1163120378543316992â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump make america great again!
@realdonaldtrump with all that this administration has accomplished, think what my poll numbers would be if we had an honest media, which we do not!
@realdonaldtrump .....â€ťjournalismâ€ť has reached a new low in the history of our country. it is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the democrat party. the reporting is so false, biased and evil that it has now become a very sick joke...but the public is aware! #crookedjournalism
@realdonaldtrump the failing new york times, in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history, got caught by a leaker that they are shifting from their phony russian collusion narrative (the mueller report & his testimony were a total disaster), to a racism witch hunt.....
@realdonaldtrump great discussion with prime minister @borisjohnson today. we talked about brexit and how we can move rapidly on a us-uk free trade deal. i look forward to meeting with boris this weekend, at the @g7, in france!
@realdonaldtrump spoke to my two good friends, prime minister modi of india, and prime minister khan of pakistan, regarding trade, strategic partnerships and, most importantly, for india and pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in kashmir. a tough situation, but good conversations!
@realdonaldtrump thank you! #maga pic.twitter.com/hfkxxb18ra
@realdonaldtrump massive overflow crowds in new hampshire last week. couldnâ€™t get into packed snhu arena. fake and corrupt news would like you to believe otherwise. make america great again! pic.twitter.com/cuiymvmqfv
@realdonaldtrump wow, report just out! google manipulated from 2.6 million to 16 million votes for hillary clinton in 2016 election! this was put out by a clinton supporter, not a trump supporter! google should be sued. my victory was even bigger than thought! @judicialwatch
@realdonaldtrump .....the fed rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. if that happened, our economy would be even better, and the world economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!
@realdonaldtrump our economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by jay powell and the fed, but the democrats are trying to â€świllâ€ť the economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 election. very selfish! our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world...
@realdonaldtrump democrats want open borders and crime! so dangerous for our country. but we are building a big, beautiful, new wall! i will protect america, the dems donâ€™t know where to start! pic.twitter.com/d0apaaxvvm
@realdonaldtrump ....got fired. wrote a very nice book about me just recently. now the book is a lie? said his wife was driving him crazy, â€śsomething bigâ€ť was happening with her. getting divorced. he was a mental wreck. we didnâ€™t want him around. now fake news puts him on like he was my buddy!
@realdonaldtrump anthony scaramucci is a highly unstable â€śnut jobâ€ť who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked, & then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. i barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself, bad on tv. abused staff,...
@realdonaldtrump great cohesion inside the republican party, the best i have ever seen. despite all of the fake news, my poll numbers are great. new internal polls show them to be the strongest weâ€™ve had so far! think what theyâ€™d be if i got fair media coverage!
@realdonaldtrump ....the prime minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the united states and denmark by being so direct. i thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!
@realdonaldtrump denmark is a very special country with incredible people, but based on prime minister mette frederiksenâ€™s comments, that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of greenland, i will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time....

@realdonaldtrump sorry, i donâ€™t buy rep. tlaibâ€™s tears. i have watched her violence, craziness and, most importantly, words, for far too long. now tears? she hates israel and all jewish people. she is an anti-semite. she and her 3 friends are the new face of the democrat party. live with it!

@realdonaldtrump great! @loudobbs interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 p.m. @foxnews
@realdonaldtrump ....that when this administrationâ€™s alternative is no longer available, california will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. only reason california is now talking to them is because the feds are giving a far better alternative, which is much better for consumers!
@realdonaldtrump henry ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesnâ€™t work as well, because execs donâ€™t want to fight california regulators. car companies should know....
@realdonaldtrump the legendary henry ford and alfred p. sloan, the founders of ford motor company and general motors, are â€śrolling overâ€ť at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good, and cost $3,000 more to consumers. crazy!
@realdonaldtrump â€śtax cuts, deregulation, and an administration dedicated to growing business have allowed the u.s. economy to flourish. the resulting surge in job creation and record low unemployment has put the american worker in the driverâ€™s seat.â€ś @secretaryross https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/the-american-consumer-now-in-a-sweet-spotâ â€¦
@realdonaldtrump .@nato, very unfair to the united states! pic.twitter.com/yigmtkpscu
@realdonaldtrump ....because of me, these countries have agreed to pay one hundred billion dollars more - but still way short of what they should pay for the incredible military protection provided. sorry!
@realdonaldtrump for the record, denmark is only at 1.35% of gdp for nato spending. they are a wealthy country and should be at 2%. we protect europe and yet, only 8 of the 28 nato countries are at the 2% mark. the united states is at a much, much higher level than that....

@realdonaldtrump ....where is the federal reserve?
@realdonaldtrump so germany is paying zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money, while the u.s., a far stronger and more important credit, is paying interest and just stopped (i hope!) quantitative tightening. strongest dollar in history, very tough on exports. no inflation!.....
@realdonaldtrump my proposal to the politically correct automobile companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. engines would run smoother. very little impact on the environment! foolish executives!
@realdonaldtrump .....we are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate, and we should be lower than them. yesterday, â€śhighest dollar in u.s.history.â€ť no inflation. wake up federal reserve. such growth potential, almost like never before!
@realdonaldtrump doing great with china and other trade deals. the only problem we have is jay powell and the fed. heâ€™s like a golfer who canâ€™t putt, has no touch. big u.s. growth if he does the right thing, big cut - but donâ€™t count on him! so far he has called it wrong, and only let us down....
@realdonaldtrump the fake news lamestream media is doing everything possible the â€ścreateâ€ť a u.s. recession, even though the numbers & facts are working totally in the opposite direction. they would be willing to hurt many people, but that doesnâ€™t matter to them. our economy is sooo strong, sorry!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe speed bump has been missteps by the federal reserve.â€ť @cvpayne @foxandfriends so true!
@realdonaldtrump rep tlaib wants to cut off aid to israel. this is the new face the of democrat party? read the aoc plus 3 statements on their hatred of jews and israel. check out rep. omar (the great people of minnesota wonâ€™t stand for this).
@realdonaldtrump brandon judd, president, national border patrol council. â€śthis will effectively end catch and release and curb illegal entries.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump .....all jews, blacks, gays, everyone. and importantly, heâ€™s good for everyone in america who wants a job.â€ť wow! @newsmax @foxandfriends @oann
@realdonaldtrump ....like heâ€™s the king of israel. they love him like he is the second coming of god...but american jews donâ€™t know him or like him. they donâ€™t even know what theyâ€™re doing or saying anymore. it makes no sense! but thatâ€™s ok, if he keeps doing what heâ€™s doing, heâ€™s good for.....
@realdonaldtrump â€śthank you to wayne allyn root for the very nice words. â€śpresident trump is the greatest president for jews and for israel in the history of the world, not just america, he is the best president for israel in the history of the world...and the jewish people in israel love him....

@realdonaldtrump just concluded a very good meeting on preventing mass shootings. talks are ongoing w/ both republicans & democrats. we are likewise engaging with lawful gun owners, survivors, grieving family members, law enforcement, the nra, mental health professionals, and school officials...
@realdonaldtrump just heard that sean spicer will be on â€śdancing with the stars.â€ť he will do great. a terrific person who loves our country dearly!
@realdonaldtrump the economy is doing really well. the federal reserve can easily make it record setting! the question is being asked, why are we paying much more in interest than germany and certain other countries? be early (for a change), not late. let america win big, rather than just win!
@realdonaldtrump germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields. germany competes with the usa. our federal reserve does not allow us to do what we must do. they put us at a disadvantage against our competition. strong dollar, no inflation! they move like quicksand. fight or go home!

@realdonaldtrump the two big congressional wins in north carolina on tuesday, daniel bishop and greg murphy, have reverberated all over the world. they showed a lot of people how strong the republican party is, and how well it is doing. 2020 is a big, and very important, election. we will win!
@realdonaldtrump ....very stupidly negotiated trade deals, and illegal immigration, are a tremendous cost and burden to our country. they are both coming along very well and someday, in the not too distant future, america will see a very positive change. remember, america first!
@realdonaldtrump illegal immigration costs the usa over 300 billion dollars a year. there is no reason for this, and things are being set in motion to have this number come way down. democrats could end loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier, and faster. but it will all happen anyway!....
@realdonaldtrump ....ig report, which showed him to be a disgraced & dirty cop. republicans have unified like never before. you donâ€™t impeach presidents for doing a good (great!) job. no obstruction, no collusion, only treasonous crimes committed by the other side, and led by the democrats. sad!
@realdonaldtrump ....became number 1 in world & independent in energy. will soon have record number of judges, 2 sc justices. done more than any president in first 2 1/2 years despite phony & fraudulent witch hunt illegally led against him. win on mueller report, mueller testimony & james comey..
@realdonaldtrump how do you impeach a president who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our country? all time best unemployment numbers, especially for blacks, hispanics, asians & women. more people working today than ever before. rebuilt military & choice for vets...

@realdonaldtrump the taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now. killing 12 people, including one great american soldier, was not a good idea. there are much better ways to set up a negotiation. the taliban knows they made a big mistake, and they have no idea how to recover!

@realdonaldtrump 94% approval rating in the republican party! tuesday night in the great state of north carolina proved that high and very beautiful number correct.
@realdonaldtrump who the hell is joy-ann reid? never met her, she knows zero about me, has no talent, and truly doesnâ€™t have the â€śitâ€ť factor needed for success in showbiz. had a bad reputation, and now works for the comcast/nbc losers making up phony stories about me. low ratings. fake news!
@realdonaldtrump â€śa very stable genius!â€ť thank you.
@realdonaldtrump the fake news is saying that i am willing to meet with iran, â€śno conditions.â€ť that is an incorrect statement (as usual!).
@realdonaldtrump here we go again with general motors and the united auto workers. get together and make a deal!
@realdonaldtrump plenty of oil!
@realdonaldtrump saudi arabia oil supply was attacked. there is reason to believe that we know the culprit, are locked and loaded depending on verification, but are waiting to hear from the kingdom as to who they believe was the cause of this attack, and under what terms we would proceed!
@realdonaldtrump ....sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied. i have also informed all appropriate agencies to expedite approvals of the oil pipelines currently in the permitting process in texas and various other states.
@realdonaldtrump based on the attack on saudi arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, i have authorized the release of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount....
@realdonaldtrump ....then, on top of it all, kathleen parker, of all people, wrote â€śin case you were wondering, trump won the debate.â€ť true, but what is going on at the @washingtonpost? not fake news!
@realdonaldtrump canâ€™t believe the @washingtonpost wrote a positive front page story, â€śunity issue has parties pointing to trump. gop goes all in, while democrats clash over ideology & tactics. mr. president, we are with you the entire way. republicans have....coalesced around trump.â€ť.....
@realdonaldtrump i am fighting the fake (corrupt) news, the deep state, the democrats, and the few remaining republicans in name only (rinos, who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation), with the help of some truly great republicans, and others. we are winning big (150th federal judge this week)!
@realdonaldtrump canâ€™t let brett kavanaugh give radical left democrat (liberal plus) opinions based on threats of impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?), false allegations, and lies. this is the game they play. fake and corrupt news is working overtime! #protectkavanaugh
@realdonaldtrump brett kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the justice department should come to his rescue. the lies being told about him are unbelievable. false accusations without recrimination. when does it stop? they are trying to influence his opinions. canâ€™t let that happen!
@realdonaldtrump thank you @foxandfriends and @repmarkmeadows. great interview!
@realdonaldtrump now the radical left democrats and their partner, the lamestream media, are after brett kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. he is an innocent man who has been treated horribly. such lies about him. they want to scare him into turning liberal!
@realdonaldtrump all based on nothing! the dems canâ€™t get anything positive done, and probably donâ€™t want to. https://twitter.com/stevescalise/status/1172911375783534594â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump i call for the resignation of everybody at the new york times involved in the kavanaugh smear story, and while youâ€™re at it, the russian witch hunt hoax, which is just as phony! theyâ€™ve taken the old grey lady and broken her down, destroyed her virtue and ruined her reputation...

@realdonaldtrump in a short while i will be presenting the new york @yankees @marianorivera, the greatest relief pitcher (closer!) of all time, with the presidential medal of freedom in the east room of the @whitehouse!
@realdonaldtrump ....for the privilege of being your president - and doing the best job that has been done in many decades. i am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening, or filling up a gas tank at an airport i do not own. these radical left democrats are crazy! obama netflix?
@realdonaldtrump they failed on the mueller report, they failed on robert muellerâ€™s testimony, they failed on everything else, so now the democrats are trying to build a case that i enrich myself by being president. good idea, except i will, and have always expected to, lose billions of dollars..
@realdonaldtrump â€śdemocrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.â€ť governor john sununu @foxnews @billhemmer the big questions are, will they â€śmove the goalpostsâ€ť and, is this just a ploy to take your guns away? i hope not on both counts, but iâ€™ll be able to figure it out!
@realdonaldtrump remember when iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their â€śairspaceâ€ť when, in fact, it was nowhere close. they stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on saudi arabia. weâ€™ll see?
@realdonaldtrump just out: â€śkavanaugh accuser doesnâ€™t recall incident.â€ť @foxandfriends do you believe what these horrible people will do or say. they are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. they should be sued!
@realdonaldtrump â€śwhatâ€™s happening to justice kavanaugh is a disgrace. this guy is not a good man, he is a great man. he has to go to his church with his family while these terrible reports are being written about him, a disgrace!â€ť daniel bongino @foxandfriends
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe new york times walks back report on kavanaugh assault claim.â€ť @foxandfriends the one who is actually being assaulted is justice kavanaugh - assaulted by lies and fake news! this is all about the lamestream media working with their partner, the dems.
@realdonaldtrump ...the united states, because of the federal reserve, is paying a much higher interest rate than other competing countries. they canâ€™t believe how lucky they are that jay powell & the fed donâ€™t have a clue. and now, on top of it all, the oil hit. big interest rate drop, stimulus!
@realdonaldtrump producer prices in china shrank most in 3 years due to chinaâ€™s big devaluation of their currency, coupled with monetary stimulus. federal reserve not watching? will fed ever get into the game? dollar strongest ever! really bad for exports. no inflation...highest interest rates...
@realdonaldtrump because we have done so well with energy over the last few years (thank you, mr. president!), we are a net energy exporter, & now the number one energy producer in the world. we donâ€™t need middle eastern oil & gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our allies!

@realdonaldtrump the @nytimes. â€śthis week, the senate passed a milestone in confirming the 150th federal judge of mr. trumpâ€™s administration to a lifetime appointment, far outstripping barack obamaâ€™s pace and fulfilling pledges by mr. trump and mr. oâ€™connell to remake the federal judiciary....
@realdonaldtrump ....work that way. i have a better idea. look at the obama book deal, or the ridiculous netflix deal. then look at all the deals made by the dems in congress, the â€ścongressional slush fund,â€ť and lastly the ig reports. take a look at them. those investigations would be over fast!
@realdonaldtrump house judiciary has given up on the mueller report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent - zero collusion, zero obstruction. so they say, ok, lets look at everything else, and all of the deals that â€śtrumpâ€ť has done over his lifetime. but it doesnâ€™t....

@realdonaldtrump one of the great things about the china deal is the fact that, for various reasons, we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex congressional approval process. when the deal is fully negotiated, i sign it myself on behalf of our country. fast and clean!
@realdonaldtrump i will be in louisiana tonight (love it!) to get republicans to vote for either of our two great republican candidates and force a run off with john bel edwards, who has done a really poor job of tax cutting, car insurance cost (worst in usa), & is suspect on your second amendment!

@realdonaldtrump louisiana, get out and vote republican before going to the big game today. a runoff will be a tremendous win for your great state - lower taxes and car insurance, and better protection of your second amendment! fantastic being with you last night!
@realdonaldtrump ....other aspects of the deal are also great - technology, financial services, 16-20 billion in boeing planes etc., but wow, the farmers really hit pay dirt! @chuckgrassley @joniernst @debfisher @bensasse thank you to all republicans in congress for your invaluable help!
@realdonaldtrump the deal i just made with china is, by far, the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our great patriot farmers in the history of our country. in fact, there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? our farmers will figure it out. thank you china!

@realdonaldtrump my deal with china is that they will immediately start buying very large quantities of our agricultural product, not wait until the deal is signed over the next 3 or 4 weeks. they have already started! likewise financial services and other deal aspects, start preparing....
@realdonaldtrump the democrats are going to lose a lot of house seats because of their fraudulent use of impeachment. schiff fabricated phone call, a crime. democrat senate seats will also be put at risk, even some that were supposedly safe. look at louisiana last night, north carolina last week!

@realdonaldtrump dealing with @lindseygrahamsc and many members of congress, including democrats, about imposing powerful sanctions on turkey. treasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. there is great consensus on this. turkey has asked that it not be done. stay tuned!
@realdonaldtrump .....the kurds and turkey have been fighting for many years. turkey considers the pkk the worst terrorists of all. others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. let them! we are monitoring the situation closely. endless wars!
@realdonaldtrump do you remember two years ago when iraq was going to fight the kurds in a different part of syria. many people wanted us to fight with the kurds against iraq, who we just fought for. i said no, and the kurds left the fight, twice. now the same thing is happening with turkey......
@realdonaldtrump very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the turkish border, for a change. those that mistakenly got us into the middle east wars are still pushing to fight. they have no idea what a bad decision they have made. why are they not asking for a declaration of war?
@realdonaldtrump the media is not talking about the big republican victory last night in louisiana where a sitting democrat governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%. big upset! now @eddierispone, who will be a great governor, will win!
@realdonaldtrump a despicable human being! https://twitter.com/danscavino/status/1183230623563034624â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump the same people that got us into the middle east quicksand, 8 trillion dollars and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side), are now fighting to keep us there. donâ€™t listen to people that havenâ€™t got a clue. they have proven to be inept!
@realdonaldtrump the governor of louisiana, john bel edwards, has done a poor job. now he is in a runoff with a great republican, @eddierispone. thank you louisiana! 66% down to 47% after i explained what a bad job the governor was doing.

@realdonaldtrump ....i would much rather focus on our southern border which abuts and is part of the united states of america. and by the way, numbers are way down and the wall is being built!
@realdonaldtrump some people want the united states to protect the 7,000 mile away border of syria, presided over by bashar al-assad, our enemy. at the same time, syria and whoever they chose to help, wants naturally to protect the kurds....
@realdonaldtrump ....and assad to protect the land of our enemy? anyone who wants to assist syria in protecting the kurds is good with me, whether it is russia, china, or napoleon bonaparte. i hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!
@realdonaldtrump after defeating 100% of the isis caliphate, i largely moved our troops out of syria. let syria and assad protect the kurds and fight turkey for their own land. i said to my generals, why should we be fighting for syria....
@realdonaldtrump ....don't the europeans have a lot of responsibility?â€ť @katiepavlich thank you katie, i offered isis prisoners to the european countries from where they came, and was rejected on numerous occasions. they probably figured that the u.s. would bear the tremendous cost as always!
@realdonaldtrump â€śto his credit the europeans did not step up to deal with this isis problem â€“ itâ€™s a lot of the reason why we are in this situation today. now, angela merkel of germany is finally stepping up and telling turkey to back off....

@realdonaldtrump brian kilmeade over at @foxandfriends got it all wrong. we are not going into another war between people who have been fighting with each other for 200 years. europe had a chance to get their isis prisoners, but didnâ€™t want the cost. â€ślet the usa pay,â€ť they said...

@realdonaldtrump ....democratâ€™s game was foiled when we caught schiff fraudulently making up my ukraine conversation, when i released the exact conversation transcript, and when ukrainian president and the foreign minister said there was no pressure, very normal talk! a total impeachment scam!
@realdonaldtrump adam schiff now doesnâ€™t seem to want the whistleblower to testify. no! must testify to explain why he got my ukraine conversation sooo wrong, not even close. did schiff tell him to do that? we must determine the whistleblowerâ€™s identity to determine why this was done to the usa..
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe democrats are trashing this president, & in the process, trashing the u.s. constitution. frankly, the american people need to wake up to the reality that the democrats are so drunk on power that theyâ€™re willing to destroy this constitutional republic.â€ť @grahamledger @oann

@realdonaldtrump shifty schiff now seems to think they donâ€™t need the whistleblower, who started the whole scam. the reason is that the whistleblower has lost all credibility because the story is so far from the facts on the transcript. also, the second whistleblower is no longer even mentioned!

@realdonaldtrump .....this thinking years ago. instead, it was always held together with very weak bandaids, & in an artificial manner. there is good will on both sides & a really good chance for success. the u.s. has secured the oil, & the isis fighters are double secured by kurds & turkey....
@realdonaldtrump just spoke to president @rterdogan of turkey. he told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated. he very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work. likewise, the kurds want it, and the ultimate solution, to happen. too bad there wasnâ€™t.....

@realdonaldtrump democrats are now the party of high taxes, high crime, open borders, late-term abortion, socialism, and blatant corruption. the republican party is the party of the american worker, the american family, and the american dream! #kag2020 pic.twitter.com/qxb198t5cm
@realdonaldtrump tonight, we forcefully condemn the blatant corruption of the democrat party, the fake news media, and the rogue bureaucrats of the deep state. the only message these radicals will understand is a crushing defeat on november 3, 2020! #kag2020 pic.twitter.com/qw1rk99o4b
@realdonaldtrump the radical left tolerates no dissent, it permits no opposition, it accepts no compromise, and it has absolutely no respect for the will of the american people. they are coming after me, because i am fighting for you! #trumprallydallas #kag2020 pic.twitter.com/othkws1bud

@realdonaldtrump such a disgrace that the do nothing democrats are doing just as their name suggests, doing nothing! usmca anyone?
@realdonaldtrump susan rice, who was a disaster to president obama as national security advisor, is now telling us her opinion on what to do in syria. remember red line in the sand? that was obama. millions killed! no thanks susan, you were a disaster.
@realdonaldtrump pelosi and impeachment - there have already been 3 votes, and theyâ€™ve all failed miserably. hereâ€™s why there may not be a fourth - 137 democrats voted against on the last vote.â€ť @jasonchaffetz @seanhannity many of those voting in favor will be beaten in 2020!
@realdonaldtrump congressman michael mccaul, â€śschiffâ€™s inquiry defies democracy.â€ť @foxnews @seanhannity
@realdonaldtrump â€śbecause the house has already voted against the impeachment proceeding, the current inquiry is totally invalid. the current sham of a so-called investigation is nothing more than an unconstitutional power grab. it needs to end.â€ť @jasonchaffetz @seanhannity corrupt adam schiff
@realdonaldtrump corrupt congressman adam schiff is angry that ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent witch hunt, are turning out to be good for me - some really good! heâ€™s got all meetings locked down, no transparency, only his illegal leaks. a very dishonest sleazebag!
@realdonaldtrump so interesting that, when i announced trump national doral in miami would be used for the hosting of the g-7, and then rescinded due to do nothing democrat/fake news anger, very few in media mentioned that no profits would be taken, or would be given free, if legally permissible!
@realdonaldtrump ....fiction to congress and the american people? i demand his deposition. he is a fraud, just like the russia hoax was, and the ukraine hoax is now. when do the do nothing democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our country, & when do the republicans finally fight back?
@realdonaldtrump ....because their so-called story didnâ€™t come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call. was it a corrupt adam schiff con? why didnâ€™t the ig see this? when do we depose shifty schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this..
@realdonaldtrump this scam going on right now by the democrats against the republican party, and me, was all about a perfect phone call i had with the ukrainian president. heâ€™s already stated, no pressure! where is the whistleblower, or the second whistleblower, or the â€śinformant?â€ť all gone.....
@realdonaldtrump pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9, including corrupt adam schiff, to jordan to check out syria. she should find out why obama drew the red line in the sand, & then did nothing, losing syria & all respect. i did something, 58 missiles. one million died under obamaâ€™s mistake!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe ceasefire is holding up very nicely. there are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. new areas being resettled with kurds. u.s. soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zone. we have secured the oil.â€ť mark esper, secretary of defense. ending endless wars!

@realdonaldtrump ....therefore, based on both media & democrat crazed and irrational hostility, we will no longer consider trump national doral, miami, as the host site for the g-7 in 2020. we will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of camp david, immediately. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump .....its own 50 to 70 unit building. would set up better than other alternatives. i announced that i would be willing to do it at no profit or, if legally permissible, at zero cost to the usa. but, as usual, the hostile media & their democrat partners went crazy!
@realdonaldtrump i thought i was doing something very good for our country by using trump national doral, in miami, for hosting the g-7 leaders. it is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to miami international airport, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have...
@realdonaldtrump will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 p.m. on @foxnews. enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump doral in miami would have been the best place to hold the g-7, and free, but too much heat from the do nothing radical left democrats & their partner, the fake news media! iâ€™m surprised that they allow me to give up my $400,000 plus presidential salary! weâ€™ll find someplace else!

@realdonaldtrump thank you republicans. 185 out of 185 present voted for â€śusâ€ť last night. really good!

@realdonaldtrump â€śi thought a very revealing poll was done by the new york times. by about a 10 point margin, those in battleground states polled are against impeaching the president, and if nancy pelosi doesnâ€™t take note of that, maybe she is the third rate politician.â€ť @kilmeade @foxandfriends

@realdonaldtrump ....usa has gained trillions of dollars in wealth since november 2016. all others way down. our power is economic before having to use our newly rebuilt military, a much better alternative. oil is secured. our soldiers have left and are leaving syria for other places, then....
@realdonaldtrump turkey fully understands not to fire on the kurds as they leave what will be known as the safe zone for other fairly nearby areas. i donâ€™t have to repeat that large scale sanctions will be imposed for violations. going well! isis secured by kurds with turkey ready as backup.....
@realdonaldtrump so congressman timothy ryan of ohio has finally dropped out of the race for president, registering zero in the polls & unable to even qualify for the debate stage. see tim, itâ€™s not so easy out there if you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing. he wasnâ€™t effective for usa workers, just talk!
@realdonaldtrump another big dropout of the presidential race was, along with 0% timothy ryan, 0% @repswalwell. such talk and bravado from both, and nothing to show. they stood for nothing, and the voters couldnâ€™t stand by them. obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!
@realdonaldtrump where is the whistleblower, and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the ukrainian president? why did the ig allow this to happen? who is the so-called informant (schiff?) who was so inaccurate? a giant scam!

@realdonaldtrump we have agreed to a very large phase one deal with china. they have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of agricultural product, energy, and manufactured goods, plus much more. the 25% tariffs will remain as is, with 7 1/2% put on much of the remainder....

@realdonaldtrump the reason the democrats donâ€™t want to submit the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they donâ€™t want corrupt politician adam shifty schiff to testify under oath, nor do they want the whistleblower, the missing second whistleblower, the informer, the bidens, to testify!
@realdonaldtrump the house democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the republicans on their impeachment hoax. the republicans have never been so united! the demâ€™s case is so bad that they donâ€™t even want to go to trial!
@realdonaldtrump so after the democrats gave me no due process in the house, no lawyers, no witnesses, no nothing, they now want to tell the senate how to run their trial. actually, they have zero proof of anything, they will never even show up. they want out. i want an immediate trial!

@realdonaldtrump ....targeted 52 iranian sites (representing the 52 american hostages taken by iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to iran & the iranian culture, and those targets, and iran itself, will be hit very fast and very hard. the usa wants no more threats!
@realdonaldtrump ....hundreds of iranian protesters. he was already attacking our embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. iran has been nothing but problems for many years. let this serve as a warning that if iran strikes any americans, or american assets, we have.....
@realdonaldtrump iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain usa assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an american, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently....
@realdonaldtrump as hard as i work, & as successful as our country has become with our economy, our military & everything else, it is ashame that the democrats make us spend so much time & money on this ridiculous impeachment lite hoax. i should be able to devote all of my time to the real usa!
@realdonaldtrump 95% approval rating in the republican party. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump these media posts will serve as notification to the united states congress that should iran strike any u.s. person or target, the united states will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner. such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!
@realdonaldtrump the united states just spent two trillion dollars on military equipment. we are the biggest and by far the best in the world! if iran attacks an american base, or any american, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!
@realdonaldtrump they attacked us, & we hit back. if they attack again, which i would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before! https://twitter.com/dancrenshawtx/status/1213583859402657793â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump ....if however, the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility, and politely asks for help from the federal government, we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run democrat cities great again!
@realdonaldtrump the homeless situation in los angeles, san francisco, and many other democrat party run cities throughout the nation is a state and local problem, not a federal problem....
@realdonaldtrump iran will never have a nuclear weapon!
@realdonaldtrump congress & the president should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan impeachment hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to zero was the republican house vote, & we got 3 dems. this was not what the founders had in mind!
@realdonaldtrump the impeachment hoax, just a continuation of the witch hunt which started even before i won the election, must end quickly. read the transcripts, see the ukrainian presidentâ€™s strong statement, no pressure - get this done. it is a con game by the dems to help with the election!
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe reason they are not sending the articles of impeachment to the senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic.â€ť @lindseygrahamsc @mariabartiromo the great scam continues. to be spending time on this political hoax at this moment in our history, when i am so busy, is sad!

@realdonaldtrump now the radical left, do nothing democrats, are asking @senatemajldr mitch mcconnell to do the job that they were unable to do. they proved nothing but my total innocence in the house, despite the most unfair & biased hearings in the history of congress. now they demand fairness!
@realdonaldtrump nancy pelosi will go down as the absolute worst speaker of the house in u.s. history!
@realdonaldtrump new polling shows that the totally partisan impeachment hoax is going nowhere. a vast majority want the do nothing democrats to move on to other things now!
@realdonaldtrump where have the radical left, do nothing democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of qassem soleimani, one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? he was also looking to do big future damage! dems are â€śunhinged.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump â€śfbi director apologizes for fisa errors (of which there were far to many to be a coincidence!).â€ť @foxnews chris, what about all of the lives that were ruined because of the so-called â€śerrors?â€ť are these â€śdirty copsâ€ť going to pay a big price for the fraud they committed?
@realdonaldtrump national security adviser suggested today that sanctions & protests have iran â€śchoked offâ€ť, will force them to negotiate. actually, i couldnâ€™t care less if they negotiate. will be totally up to them but, no nuclear weapons and â€śdonâ€™t kill your protesters.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump many believe that by the senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, â€śno pressureâ€ť impeachment hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan democrat witch hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. i agree!
@realdonaldtrump wow! crazy bernie sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the do nothing party. so what does this all mean? stay tuned!
@realdonaldtrump you canâ€™t make this up! david kris, a highly controversial former doj official, was just appointed by the fisa court to oversee reforms to the fbiâ€™s surveillance procedures. zero credibility. the swamp! @devinnunes @mariabartiromo @foxnews

@realdonaldtrump why should i have the stigma of impeachment attached to my name when i did nothing wrong? read the transcripts! a totally partisan hoax, never happened before. house republicans voted 195-0, with three dems voting with the republicans. very unfair to tens of millions of voters!
@realdonaldtrump why did nervous nancy allow corrupt politician shifty schiff to lie before congress? he must be a witness, and so should she!
@realdonaldtrump great idea. this phony impeachment hoax should not even be allowed to proceed. did nothing wrong. just a partisan vote. zero republicans. never happened before! https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1216212972391096320â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump john kerry got caught essentially admitting that funds given ridiculously to iran were used to fund attacks on the usa. only a complete fool would have given that 150 billion dollars plus to iran. they then went on a middle east rampage! @foxandfriends @petehegseth
@realdonaldtrump george @gstephanopoulos, ask crazy nancy why she allowed adam â€śshiftyâ€ť schiff to totally make up my conversation with the ukrainian president & read his false words to congress and the world, as though i said it? he got caught! ask why hearing was most unfair & biased in history?
@realdonaldtrump to the leaders of iran - do not kill your protesters. thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the world is watching. more importantly, the usa is watching. turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! stop the killing of your great iranian people!

@realdonaldtrump the fake news media and their democrat partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist soleimani was â€śimminentâ€ť or not, & was my team in agreement. the answer to both is a strong yes., but it doesnâ€™t really matter because of his horrible past!
@realdonaldtrump wow! the wonderful iranian protesters refused to step on, or in any way denigrate, our great american flag. it was put on the street in order for them to trample it, and they walked around it instead. big progress!
@realdonaldtrump the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy, only because i did what should have been done for 20 years. anything i do, whether itâ€™s the economy, military, or anything else, will be scorned by the rafical left, do nothing democrats!
@realdonaldtrump bernie sanderâ€™s volunteers are trashing elizabeth â€śpocahontusâ€ť warren. everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. mini mike b is also trying, but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. elizabeth is very angry at bernie. do i see a feud brewing?

@realdonaldtrump mini mike bloomberg is spending a lot of money on false advertising. i was the person who saved pre-existing conditions in your healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular individual mandate.....
@realdonaldtrump cryinâ€™ chuck schumer just said, â€śthe american people want a fair trial in the senate.â€ť true, but why didnâ€™t nervous nancy and corrupt politician adam â€śshiftyâ€ť schiff give us a fair trial in the house. it was the most lopsided & unfair basement hearing in the history of congress!

@realdonaldtrump mini mike is now negotiating both to get on the democrat primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. this is sometimes done, but really not fair!
@realdonaldtrump many of the ads you are watching were paid for by mini mike bloomberg. he is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the dnc to rig the election against crazy bernie, something they wouldnâ€™t do for @corybooker and others. they are doing it to bernie again, 2016.
@realdonaldtrump mini mike is part of the fake news. they are all working together. in fact, bloomberg isnâ€™t covering himself (too boring to do), or other dems. only trump. that sounds fair! itâ€™s all the fake news media, and thatâ€™s why nobody believes in them any more.
@realdonaldtrump the radical left, do nothing democrats, donâ€™t want justice when pushing the impeachment hoax, they only want to destabilize the republican party so they can do better in the 2020 election, & that includes the house & senate. they are playing with the people by taking it this far!

@realdonaldtrump when will the democrats start blaming russia, russia, russia, instead of their own incompetence for the voting disaster that just happened in the great state of iowa?

@realdonaldtrump .@dagenmcdowell, â€śevery democrat is running to raise taxes. she (pocahontas) lied about her ethnicity, that was her problem.â€ť @mariabartiromo so true dagen!
@realdonaldtrump two months in jail for a swamp creature, yet 9 years recommended for roger stone (who was not even working for the trump campaign). gee, that sounds very fair! rogue prosecutors maybe? the swamp! @foxandfriends @tuckercarlson
@realdonaldtrump congratulations to attorney general bill barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. evidence now clearly shows that the mueller scam was improperly brought & tainted. even bob mueller lied to congress!
@realdonaldtrump fake news @cnn and msdnc have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in new hampshire (and in iowa). thatâ€™s why they are poorly rated fake news! i will win both states in november.
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media is looking hard for the big democrat story, but there is nothing too fabulous. wouldnâ€™t a big story be that i got more new hampshire primary votes than any incumbent president, in either party, in the history of that great state? not an insignificant fact!

@realdonaldtrump who are the four prosecutors (mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal, the mueller scam, and shouldnâ€™t ever even have started? 13 angry democrats?
@realdonaldtrump impeachment king steyer (how did that work out?) spent 200 million dollars and got less than 1% of the vote in iowa, and only 3% of the vote in new hampshire. could it be that something is just plain missing? not easy to do what i did, is it?
@realdonaldtrump elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to as pocahontas, is having a really bad night. i think she is sending signals that she wants out. calling for unity is her way of getting there, going home, and having a â€śnice cold beerâ€ť with her husband!
@realdonaldtrump whatever happened to hillary campaign manager podestaâ€™s brother? wasnâ€™t he caught, forced to leave his firm, with big bad things to happen? why did nothing ever happen to him, only to the â€śotherâ€ť side?
@realdonaldtrump ...and a swamp creature with â€śpullâ€ť was just sentenced to two months in jail for a similar thing that they want stone to serve 9 years for. a phony mueller witch hunt disgrace. caught! https://twitter.com/cbs_herridge/status/1227286163939000320â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump iâ€™m seeing governor cuomo today at the white house. he must understand that national security far exceeds politics. new york must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits & harrassment, start cleaning itself up, and lowering taxes. build relationships, but donâ€™t bring fredo!
@realdonaldtrump ....which he actually has a military and legal obligation to do. his incredible wife, karen, who i have a lot of respect for, once pulled me aside & said strongly that â€śjohn respects you greatly. when we are no longer here, he will only speak well of you.â€ť wrong!
@realdonaldtrump when i terminated john kelly, which i couldnâ€™t do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head. being chief of staff just wasnâ€™t for him. he came in with a bang, went out with a whimper, but like so many xâ€™s, he misses the action & just canâ€™t keep his mouth shut,.
@realdonaldtrump drain the swamp! we want bad people out of our government!
@realdonaldtrump mini mike is a 5â€™4â€ť mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians. no boxes please. he hates crazy bernie and will, with enough money, possibly stop him. bernieâ€™s people will go nuts!
@realdonaldtrump mini mike bloomberg is a loser who has money but canâ€™t debate and has zero presence, you will see. he reminds me of a tiny version of jeb â€ślow energyâ€ť bush, but jeb has more political skill and has treated the black community much better than mini! https://twitter.com/danscavino/status/1227923602135244801â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump ....the reason for this is that the do nothing democrats, using disinformation hoax number 7, donâ€™t want bernie sanders to get the democrat nomination, and they figure this would be very bad for his chances. itâ€™s all rigged, again, against crazy bernie sanders!
@realdonaldtrump msdnc (comcast slime), @cnn and others of the fake media, have now added crazy bernie to the list of russian sympathizers, along with @tulsigabbard & jill stein (of the green party), both agents of russia, they say. but now they report president putin wants bernie (or me) to win.

@realdonaldtrump so, the coronavirus, which started in china and spread to various countries throughout the world, but very slowly in the u.s. because president trump closed our border, and ended flights, very early, is now being blamed, by the do nothing democrats, to be the fault of â€śtrumpâ€ť.

@realdonaldtrump thank you @jackbrewerbsi. weâ€™re with you all the way. the american people know whatâ€™s going on, they totally get it. watch what happens in november 2020! thank you for your continued support. together, we are going to keep america great! #blackvoicesfortrump https://twitter.com/teamtrump/status/1234686346603552768â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump the democrats in the house should propose a very simple one year payroll tax cut. great for the middle class, great for the usa!
@realdonaldtrump this is an incredible time for our nationâ€”we are in the midst of the great american comeback! jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging, and we have completely rebuilt the awesome power of the u.s. military. promises made, promises kept! pic.twitter.com/d5rqu1n3y0

@realdonaldtrump congress has agreed to provide $8 billion to fight coronavirus! this means @cdcgov, @hhsgov, and @dhsgov will have the resources they need to keep america safe and keep the risk to workers and families very low. this is great news for our health, our economy, and our nation!
@realdonaldtrump will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 p.m. eastern on @foxnews. enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump pandering mini mike bloomberg, along with his wacky friend, tom steyer, have found out the hard way that you canâ€™t buy the election! they both wish they had it to do over again!
@realdonaldtrump today, it was my great honor to address the @latinocoalition legislative summit. with the hard work, love & devotion of millions of incredible hispanic-americans, our country is thriving, our people are prospering, and our future has never looked brighter! https://www.pscp.tv/w/cs6ngdfvtlfstfjub1dwuxd8mvlws2trtwxyuxdkaibxf8w7xxjww0n-jdbsozrjgrf-qspw3rvdtzxahl9d?t=1sâ â€¦
@realdonaldtrump mini mike, â€śthree months ago i entered the race for president to defeat donald trump, (and i failed miserably!).
@realdonaldtrump mini mike bloomberg will now fire timothy oâ€™brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this mess. this has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of his life...and now on to sleepy joe!
@realdonaldtrump mini mike bloomberg just â€śquitâ€ť the race for president. i could have told him long ago that he didnâ€™t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. now he will pour money into sleepy joeâ€™s campaign, hoping to save face. it wonâ€™t work!
@realdonaldtrump the mayor of los angeles, @ericgarcetti, is dealing with us trying to get the federal government to fix the terrible problem he and the dems have caused with the homeless, and the horrendous effects it is having on the city, which is a mess. i then watch him talk â€śtrashâ€ť on me!
@realdonaldtrump wow! if elizabeth warren wasnâ€™t in the race, bernie sanders would have easily won massachusetts, minnesota and texas, not to mention various other states. our modern day pocahontas wonâ€™t go down in history as a winner, but she may very well go down as the all time great spoiler!
@realdonaldtrump the great people of montana can have no better voice than senator @stevedaines. he is doing an incredible job! whoever the democrat nominee may be, please understand that i will be working hard with steve all the way, & last night i was 20 for 20 (per @gopleader). we need steve!
@realdonaldtrump i will be going to the great state of tennessee on friday. the usa stands with the people of tennessee 100%, whatever they need! the tornadoes were of record size & velocity. god bless your loved ones & all of the families affected! thanks to @govbilllee & @marshablackburn
@realdonaldtrump make america great again and then, keep america great!!!!
@realdonaldtrump this is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed attorney general of the united states & then doesnâ€™t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony russia witch hunt. recuses himself on first day in office, and the mueller scam begins! https://twitter.com/politico/status/1235056416995586048â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump so selfish for elizabeth warren to stay in the race. she has zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts bernie badly. so much for their wonderful liberal friendship. will he ever speak to her again? she cost him massachusetts (and came in third), he shouldnâ€™t!
@realdonaldtrump the democrat establishment came together and crushed bernie sanders, again! even the fact that elizabeth warren stayed in the race was devastating to bernie and allowed sleepy joe to unthinkably win massachusetts. it was a perfect storm, with many good states remaining for joe!

@realdonaldtrump elizabeth â€śpocahontasâ€ť warren, other than mini mike, was the loser of the night. she didnâ€™t even come close to winning her home state of massachusetts. well, now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer!
@realdonaldtrump the biggest loser tonight, by far, is mini mike bloomberg. his â€śpoliticalâ€ť consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname mini mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. way to go mike!

@realdonaldtrump gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the coronavirus situation. the april 2009-10 swine flu, where nearly 13,000 people died in the u.s., was poorly handled. ask msdnc & lightweight washington failure @ronaldklain, who the president was then?
@realdonaldtrump the department of education is not closing hundreds of schools in rural areas of our country. this is just more fake news. we are investing greatly in our schools, and always will!
@realdonaldtrump mini mike, youâ€™re easy! pic.twitter.com/rxfiqsb9rq https://twitter.com/mikebloomberg/status/1235232463045177344â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump with approximately 100,000 coronavirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the united states, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 americans brought in) and 11 deaths. we are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!
@realdonaldtrump â€śjoe biden represents the past. president trump represents the future.â€ť @lisamarieboothe @edhenry @foxnews
@realdonaldtrump elizabeth â€śpocahontasâ€ť warren, who was going nowhere except into mini mikeâ€™s head, just dropped out of the democrat primary...three days too late. she cost crazy bernie, at least, massachusetts, minnesota and texas. probably cost him the nomination! came in third in mass.
@realdonaldtrump .@gopleader kevin mccarthy informed me that i was 20 for 20 on tuesday with respect to my endorsement of candidates. sadly, i didnâ€™t get that information from the fake news media. they donâ€™t report those things, or the far more than dems cumulative votes, despite no opposition!
@realdonaldtrump â€śi want to commend the president for how he has handled the coronavirus situation, especially his early decision to shut down access into our country from china, despite strong opposition to that decision.â€ť @sentomcotton thank you tom!
@realdonaldtrump schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the united states supreme court!
@realdonaldtrump i never said people that are feeling sick should go to work. this is just more fake news and disinformation put out by the democrats, in particular msdnc. comcast covers the coronavirus situation horribly, only looking to do harm to the incredible & successful effort being made!
@realdonaldtrump as per recent federal court ruling, the federal government will be withholding funds from sanctuary cities. they should change their status and go non-sanctuary. do not protect criminals!
@realdonaldtrump i will be interviewed by @seanhannity on @foxnews at 9:10 p.m.
@realdonaldtrump retired four star general jack keane will receive the presidential medal of freedom next week!
@realdonaldtrump there can be few things worse in a civilized, law abiding nation, than a united states senator openly, and for all to see and hear, threatening the supreme court or its justices. this is what chuck schumer just did. he must pay a severe price for this!
@realdonaldtrump this is a direct & dangerous threat to the u.s. supreme court by schumer. if a republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached. serious action must be taken now! https://twitter.com/jim_jordan/status/1235306945864663044â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump we have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the white house for our attack on coronavirus. we moved very early to close borders to certain areas, which was a godsend. v.p. is doing a great job. the fake news media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. sad!

@realdonaldtrump we have now learned for sure that the democrats donâ€™t want anything to do with crazy bernie. rigged? first @amyklobuchar & @petebuttigieg quit the race & come out for sleepy joe before super tuesday. pocahontas says no & quits race after election, thereby depriving bernie of at..

@realdonaldtrump so last year 37,000 americans died from the common flu. it averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. at this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 22 deaths. think about that!
@realdonaldtrump saudi arabia and russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. that, and the fake news, is the reason for the market drop!

@realdonaldtrump the obama/biden administration is the most corrupt administration in the history of our country!

@realdonaldtrump now the democrats are trying to smear bernie with russia, russia, russia. they are driving him crazy!
@realdonaldtrump elizabeth â€śpocahontasâ€ť warren singlehandedly destroyed the bernie sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on super t. he lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. the dnc is doing it to bernie again! will he ever get angry?
@realdonaldtrump cryinâ€™ chuck schumer said, â€śyou will pay the price for this. you wonâ€™t know what hit you.â€ť that is far beyond simple rhetoric. that is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us.â€ť trouble ahead!
@realdonaldtrump the fake news media and their partner, the democrat party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the coronavirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. surgeon general, â€śthe risk is low to the average american.â€ť

@realdonaldtrump if you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, approve a payroll tax cut until the end of the year, december 31. then you are doing something that is really meaningful. only that will make a big difference!
@realdonaldtrump .... their response to h1n1 swine flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. the changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. all red tape has been cut, ready to go!
@realdonaldtrump for decades the @cdcgov looked at, and studied, its testing system, but did nothing about it. it would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. president obama made changes that only complicated things further.....
@realdonaldtrump â€śthe obama white house had to immediately issue an apology for joe bidenâ€™s remarks, and any alarm that he might have caused, an alarm about a swine flu outbreak that took 6 months for president obama to declare a national emergency, and that killed 12,000 americans.â€ť @loudobbs
@realdonaldtrump sleepy joe biden was in charge of the h1n1 swine flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. the response was one of the worst on record. our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% approval rating, the highest on record. his was lowest!
@realdonaldtrump just had a great conversation with prime minister abe of japan. i told him that the just completed olympic venue is magnificent. he has done an incredible job, one that will make him very proud. good things will happen for japan and their great prime minister. lots of options!
@realdonaldtrump tomorrow i have called for a national day of prayer. i will be tuning in to pastor @jentezen at the @freechapel church in gainesville, georgia at 11:00 am edt. god bless the usa! http://freechapel.org/liveâ https://twitter.com/jentezen/status/1238804829654450178â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump the @cdcgov has published guidelines on http://coronavirus.govâ to enable every american to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families and their communities.
@realdonaldtrump just had a nice conversation with prime minister @justintrudeau of canada. great to hear that his wonderful wife sophie is doing very well. the united states and canada will continue to coordinate closely together on covid-19.

@realdonaldtrump good teamwork between republicans & democrats as the house passes the big coronavirus relief bill. people really pulled together. nice to see!
@realdonaldtrump to those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, i want you to know that your federal government will unleash every authority, resource and tool at its disposal to safeguard the lives and health of our people. pic.twitter.com/uvdy12vxam
@realdonaldtrump ....the health and well-being of american families first. look forward to signing the final bill, asap!
@realdonaldtrump ....the secretary of the treasury and the secretary of labor to issue regulations that will provide flexibility so that in no way will small businesses be hurt. i encourage all republicans and democrats to come together and vote yes! i will always put....
@realdonaldtrump i fully support h.r. 6201: families first coronavirus response act, which will be voted on in the house this evening. this bill will follow my direction for free coronavirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted american workers. i have directed....
@realdonaldtrump the individual governors of states, and local officials, must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights, working in conjunction with @cdcgov and the federal government!
@realdonaldtrump the fake and corrupt news never called google. they said this was not true. even in times such as these, they are not truthful. watch for their apology, it wonâ€™t happen. more importantly, thank you to google! https://twitter.com/google_comms/status/1238989156610707456â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump so now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the fbi, working in conjunction with the justice department, has â€ślostâ€ť the records of general michael flynn. how convenient. i am strongly considering a full pardon!
@realdonaldtrump canâ€™t believe they are not going after schumer for the threats he made to our cherished united states supreme court, and our two great justices. if a republican did that, there would be an endless price to pay. pathetic!
@realdonaldtrump ....the usa was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the h1n1 swine flu (biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. great decision to close our china, and other, borders early. saved many lives!
@realdonaldtrump there will be a news conference by the coronavirus task force today at the white house, 5 p.m. @vp we are working closely with the governors of our countryâ€™s great states, which are a very big factor. they are working hard, along with us, to get the job properly done.....
@realdonaldtrump we are doing very precise medical screenings at our airports. pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. we must get it right. safety first!
@realdonaldtrump i am watching a great and beautiful service by pastor jentezen franklin. thank you! @jentezen

@realdonaldtrump yesterday i spoke with the great american grocers and supply chain executives. we are confident that supply will continue to meet demand nationwide. these beacons of our community will remain open for you, no matter what. we are working hard to remove any barriers to that effort!
@realdonaldtrump just had a very good tele-conference with nationâ€™s governors. went very well. cuomo of new york has to â€śdo moreâ€ť.
@realdonaldtrump everybody is so well unified and working so hard. it is a beautiful thing to see. they love our great country. we will end up being stronger than ever before!
@realdonaldtrump god bless the usa!
@realdonaldtrump i must say, that was a very boring debate. biden lied when he said i want to cut social security and medicare. thatâ€™s what they all said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, i saved social security and medicare. i will not be cutting, but they will. be careful!
@realdonaldtrump the world is at war with a hidden enemy. we will win!
@realdonaldtrump federal government is working very well with the governors and state officials. good things will happen! #killthevirus
@realdonaldtrump failing michigan governor must work harder and be much more proactive. we are pushing her to get the job done. i stand with michigan!
@realdonaldtrump cuomo wants â€śall states to be treated the same.â€ť but all states arenâ€™t the same. some are being hit hard by the chinese virus, some are being hit practically not at all. new york is a very big â€śhotspotâ€ť, west virginia has, thus far, zero cases. andrew, keep politics out of it....

@realdonaldtrump i always treated the chinese virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the â€śbordersâ€ť from china - against the wishes of almost all. many lives were saved. the fake news new narrative is disgraceful & false!
@realdonaldtrump i will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the fda concerning the chinese virus!
@realdonaldtrump i will totally protect your medicare & social security!
@realdonaldtrump for the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. the onslaught of the chinese virus is not your fault! will be stronger than ever!

@realdonaldtrump we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. at the end of the 15 day period, we will make a decision as to which way we want to go!
@realdonaldtrump i watch and listen to the fake news, cnn, msdnc, abc, nbc, cbs, some of fox (desperately & foolishly pleading to be politically correct), the @nytimes, & the @washingtonpost, and all i see is hatred of me at any cost. donâ€™t they understand that they are destroying themselves?
@realdonaldtrump my friend (always there when iâ€™ve needed him!), senator @randpaul, was just tested â€śpositiveâ€ť from the chinese virus. that is not good! he is strong and will get better. just spoke to him and he was in good spirits.
@realdonaldtrump price transparency is so important for the people of our country. in many ways, it will prove to be as important as healthcare itself. a great issue for both republicans and democrats. hopefully it will be approved!
@realdonaldtrump will be doing a town hall on @foxnews at 12:05 p.m. (now). i will go on around 1:00 p.m. enjoy!
@realdonaldtrump our people want to return to work. they will practice social distancing and all else, and seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. we can do two things together. the cure cannot be worse (by far) than the problem! congress must act now. we will come back strong!
@realdonaldtrump congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. the longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. our workers will be hurt!
@realdonaldtrump this is not about the ridiculous green new deal. it is about putting our great workers and companies back to work!
@realdonaldtrump the defense production act is in full force, but havenâ€™t had to use it because no one has said no! millions of masks coming as back up to states.

@realdonaldtrump republicans had a deal until nancy pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. the democrats want the virus to win? they are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. they want open borders & green new deal. republicans shouldnâ€™t agree!
@realdonaldtrump ....us since the beginning of this crisis.â€ť they meant the opposite? forgot to mention that i closed our country to china (and europe) very early, long before it was considered acceptable to do so. sleepy joe said i was â€śxenophobicâ€ť, but i saved thousands of lives! fake news!
@realdonaldtrump this is the way the @nytimes finished a story on me. â€śyou can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that vp biden (sleepy joe) has shown, and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that mr. (not pres.) trump has shown....
@realdonaldtrump ....i have been packed all day with meetings, i have no time for stupidity. weâ€™re working around the clock to keep america safe!
@realdonaldtrump i hear that fake news cnn just reported that i am isolated in the white house, wondering out loud, â€śwhen will life return to normal?â€ť does anybody really believe that? there was no leak, they made it up â€“ they are corrupt & fake news....
@realdonaldtrump the lamestream media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. the real people want to get back to work asap. we will be stronger than ever before!

@realdonaldtrump will someone please explain to the fake news new york times (all the news thatâ€™s not fit to print) that the democrats make it almost impossible for us to fill positions within government. they â€śmaximumâ€ť delay even the best candidates, including judges, leaving little time!
@realdonaldtrump we have just purchased many ventilators from some wonderful companies. names and numbers will be announced later today!
@realdonaldtrump invoke â€śpâ€ť means defense production act!
@realdonaldtrump general motors must immediately open their stupidly abandoned lordstown plant in ohio, or some other plant, and start making ventilators, now!!!!!! ford, get going on ventilators, fast!!!!!! @generalmotors @ford
@realdonaldtrump as usual with â€śthisâ€ť general motors, things just never seem to work out. they said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed ventilators, â€śvery quicklyâ€ť. now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late april, and they want top dollar. always a mess with mary b. invoke â€śpâ€ť.

@realdonaldtrump by empowering the radical left democrats, do nothing kentucky politician @repthomasmassie is making their war on the second amendment more and more difficult to win (but donâ€™t worry, we will win anyway!). he is a disaster for america, and for the great state of kentucky!
@realdonaldtrump ...& costly. workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. virus wasnâ€™t their fault. it is â€śhellâ€ť dealing with the dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the â€śbig pictureâ€ť done. 90% great! win back house, but throw massie out of republican party!
@realdonaldtrump looks like a third rate grandstander named @repthomasmassie, a congressman from, unfortunately, a truly great state, kentucky, wants to vote against the new save our workers bill in congress. he just wants the publicity. he canâ€™t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous......

@realdonaldtrump ....very often fake news. lamestream media should be forced to reveal sources, very much as they did in the long ago past. if they did that, the media would be trusted again, and fake news would largely be a thing of the past!
@realdonaldtrump one of the reasons that fake news has become so prevalent & far reaching is the fact that corrupt â€śjournalistsâ€ť base their stories on sources that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story. when you see, â€śfive sources sayâ€ť, donâ€™t believe the story, it is....
@realdonaldtrump so much of the lamestream media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. they are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. these are very dangerous & corrupt people, who will do anything to win. name your sources!
@realdonaldtrump more fake news! https://twitter.com/santucci/status/1243708703972433927â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump such fake reporting by the @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @cnn & others. they use a small portion of a sentence out of a full paragraph in order to demean. they really are corrupt and disgusting. no wonder the media is, according to polls, record setting low & untrusted. #maga
@realdonaldtrump i love michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a great job for them during this horrible pandemic. yet your governor, gretchen â€śhalfâ€ť whitmer is way in over her head, she doesnâ€™t have a clue. likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #maga

@realdonaldtrump governors, get your states testing programs & apparatus perfected. be ready, big things are happening. no excuses! the federal government is there to help. we are testing more than any country in the world. also, gear up with face masks!
@realdonaldtrump the opposition party (lamestream media) and their partner, the radical left, do nothing democrats, have put their political game plan in full swing. â€śwhether he is right or wrong, it doesnâ€™t matter. criticize â€™trumpâ€™ for everything, and donâ€™t let the public see biden. hide him.â€ť
@realdonaldtrump if the fake news opposition party is pushing, with all their might, the fact that president trump â€śignored early warnings about the threat,â€ť then why did media & dems viciously criticize me when i instituted a travel ban on china? they said â€śearly & not necessary.â€ť corrupt media!
@realdonaldtrump just watched mike wallace wannabe, chris wallace, on @foxnews. i am now convinced that he is even worse than sleepy eyes chuck todd of meet the press(please!), or the people over at deface the nation. what the hell is happening to @foxnews. itâ€™s a whole new ballgame over there!
@realdonaldtrump the big oil deal with opec plus is done. this will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the united states. i would like to thank and congratulate president putin of russia and king salman of saudi arabia. i just spoke to them from the oval office. great deal for all!
@realdonaldtrump for the first time in history there is a fully signed presidential disaster declaration for all 50 states. we are winning, and will win, the war on the invisible enemy!
@realdonaldtrump great businessman & philanthropist bernie marcus, co-founder of home depot, said that congress was too distracted by the (phony) impeachment witch hunt when they should have been investigating coronavirus when it first appeared in china. media played a big roll also!@dcexaminer
@realdonaldtrump happy easter!
@realdonaldtrump a very good sign is that empty hospital beds are becoming more and more prevalent. we deployed 418 doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists from the hospital ship comfort and the javits convention center to hospitals in new york city & state. have more bed capacity than was needed. good!

@realdonaldtrump first the fake news media said that itâ€™s not fair for the president of the united states to be giving news conferences, but it is the only way i can reach the american people, as seen in the below poll. pic.twitter.com/xp2rqjqtaf
@realdonaldtrump white house news conference today at 5:00 p.m. eastern. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump ....it is the decision of the president, and for many good reasons. with that being said, the administration and i are working closely with the governors, and this will continue. a decision by me, in conjunction with the governors and input from others, will be made shortly!
@realdonaldtrump for the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the fake news media are saying that it is the governors decision to open up the states, not that of the president of the united states & the federal government. let it be fully understood that this is incorrect....
@realdonaldtrump ....disaster, the energy industry will be strong again, far faster than currently anticipated. thank you to all of those who worked with me on getting this very big business back on track, in particular russia and saudi arabia.
@realdonaldtrump having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that opec+ is looking to cut is 20 million barrels a day, not the 10 million that is generally being reported. if anything near this happens, and the world gets back to business from the covid 19.....
@realdonaldtrump the @nytimes story is a fake, just like the â€śpaperâ€ť itself. i was criticized for moving too fast when i issued the china ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @secazar told me nothing until later, and peter navarro memo was same as ban (see his statements). fake news!
@realdonaldtrump i am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the lamestream media. that part is easy, the hard part is why?

@realdonaldtrump tell the democrat governors that â€śmutiny on the bountyâ€ť was one of my all time favorite movies. a good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the captain. too easy!

@realdonaldtrump cuomoâ€™s been calling daily, even hourly, begging for everything, most of which should have been the stateâ€™s responsibility, such as new hospitals, beds, ventilators, etcetera. i got it all done for him, and everyone else, and now he seems to want independence! that wonâ€™t happen!

@realdonaldtrump china has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the invisible enemy. it is far higher than that and far higher than the u.s., not even close!
@realdonaldtrump biden/obama were a disaster in handling the h1n1 swine flu. polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! also, donâ€™t forget their 5 billion dollar obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!

@realdonaldtrump the most often used phrase in the lamestream media, by far, is â€śsources sayâ€ť, or â€śofficials who spoke on the condition of anonymityâ€ť, or anything similar which allows fake news to make up a phony quote from a person who doesnâ€™t even exist. the american people should demand names!
@realdonaldtrump ....them happy, or even a little bit satisfied. they were rude and nasty. this is their political playbook, and they will use it right up to the election on november 3rd. they will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. america will not be fooled!!!
@realdonaldtrump ....example! v.p. mike pence held a conference call yesterday with all democrat senators. he gave them everything that they would have wanted to hear in terms of gaining ground on the coronavirus, but nothing that anyone could have said, including â€śitâ€™s overâ€ť, could have made....
@realdonaldtrump no matter what you do for the do nothing democrats, no matter how great a job you are doing, they will only respond to their fake partners in the lamestream media in the negative, even in a time of crisis. i thought it would be different, but itâ€™s not. in fact, itâ€™s even worse...

@realdonaldtrump last month all you heard from the radical left, do nothing democrats was, â€śventilators, ventilators, ventilators.â€ť they screamed it loud & clear, & thought they had us cold, even though it was the stateâ€™s task. but everyone got their vâ€™s, with many to spare. now they scream....

@realdonaldtrump it is amazing that i became president of the united states with such a totally corrupt and dishonest lamestream media going after me all day, and all night. either iâ€™m really good, far better than the fake news wants to admit, or they donâ€™t have nearly the power as once thought!

@realdonaldtrump i will never let our post office fail. it has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. the people that work there are great, and weâ€™re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!
@realdonaldtrump great conversation with president lenin moreno of the republic of ecuador. we will be sending them desperately needed ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. they are fighting hard against coronavirus!
@realdonaldtrump just spoke to president juan orlando hernandez of the republic of honduras. we work closely together on the southern border. will be helping him with his request for ventilators and testing.
@realdonaldtrump great news! randall stephenson, the Chief Executive Officer of heavily indebted at&t, which owns and presides over fake news @cnn, is leaving, or was forced out. anyone who lets a garbage â€śnetworkâ€ť do and say the things that cnn does, should leave asap. hopefully replacement will be much better!
@realdonaldtrump i (or @vp) never gave governor brian kemp an okay on those few businesses outside of the guidelines. fake news! spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, & barber shops should take a little slower path, but i told the governor to do what is right for the great people of georgia (& usa)!
@realdonaldtrump just spoke to president nayib bukele of el salvador. will be helping them with ventilators, which are desperately needed. they have worked well with us on immigration at the southern border!
@realdonaldtrump just spoke to my friend, president joko widodo of the republic of indonesia. asking for ventilators, which we will provide. great cooperation between us!
@realdonaldtrump our country wants to move safely forward. there is a tremendous pent up demand. we will open big!
@realdonaldtrump the fake and totally corrupt news is after her as a means of getting to me. sheâ€™s smart and strong, knows the truth. already a heroine to many! https://twitter.com/gopchairwoman/status/1253495197805301762â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump getting very good reviews of the job the federal government is doing on coronavirus. ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, testing, have been handled incredibly well. testing is getting exponentially better every day. love seeing our country safely opening up!
@realdonaldtrump important news! https://twitter.com/whitehouse/status/1253102278971666437â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump disgraceful. should join the republican party! https://twitter.com/gopchairwoman/status/1253495197805301762â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump remember, the cure canâ€™t be worse than the problem itself. be careful, be safe, use common sense!
@realdonaldtrump what is the purpose of having white house news conferences when the lamestream media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. they get record ratings, & the american people get nothing but fake news. not worth the time & effort!
@realdonaldtrump was just informed that the fake news from the thursday white house press conference had me speaking & asking questions of dr. deborah birx. wrong, i was speaking to our laboratory expert, not deborah, about sunlight etcetera. & the coronavirus. the lamestream media is corrupt & sick!
@realdonaldtrump the do nothing democrats are spending much of their money on fake ads. i never said that the coronavirus is a â€śhoaxâ€ť, i said that the democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a hoax. also, it did start with â€śone person from chinaâ€ť, and then grew, & will be a â€śmiracleâ€ť end!
@realdonaldtrump just spoke to prime minister abiy ahmed ali of ethiopia. his country needs ventilators, and the u.s. is in good position to help him. we will!
@realdonaldtrump many testing sites are, and have been, open & available. just passed 5 million tests, far more than any other country in the world. in fact, more than all other major countries combined! donâ€™t believe the fake news! https://twitter.com/cdcgov/status/1253768673338118144â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump .@tripleh is a total winner! https://twitter.com/vincemcmahon/status/1253768179517657088â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump thank you to william perry pendley of the bureau of land management. great job on @tuckercarlson describing some of the most beautiful land in the world! @foxnews
@realdonaldtrump does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called noble (not nobel) prize is, especially as it pertains to reporters and journalists? noble is defined as, â€śhaving or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.â€ť does sarcasm ever work?
@realdonaldtrump reports that h.h.s. secretary @alexazar is going to be â€śfiredâ€ť by me are fake news. the lamestream media knows this, but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos & havoc in the minds of the public. they never even called to ask. alex is doing an excellent job!
@realdonaldtrump ....fraud @donnabrazile (and others who are even worse). chris wallace is nastier to republicans than even deface the nation or sleepy eyes. the people who are watching @foxnews, in record numbers (thank you president trump), are angry. they want an alternative now. so do i!
@realdonaldtrump ....even the radical left do nothing democrats laughed at the fox suggestion. no respect for the people running @foxnews. but fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct. they put rino paul ryan on their board. they hire â€śdebate questions to crooked hillaryâ€ť....
@realdonaldtrump .@foxnews just doesnâ€™t get whatâ€™s happening! they are being fed democrat talking points, and they play them without hesitation or research. they forgot that fake news @cnn & msdnc wouldnâ€™t let @foxnews participate, even a little bit, in the poor ratings democrat debates.....
@realdonaldtrump ....schedule and eating habits, written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me. i will often be in the oval office late into the night & read & see that i am angrily eating a hamburger & diet coke in my bedroom. people with me are always stunned. anything to demean!
@realdonaldtrump i work from early in the morning until late at night, havenâ€™t left the white house in many months (except to launch hospital ship comfort) in order to take care of trade deals, military rebuilding etc., and then i read a phony story in the failing @nytimes about my work....
@realdonaldtrump the people that know me and know the history of our country say that i am the hardest working president in history. i donâ€™t know about that, but i am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any president in history. the fake news hates it!
@realdonaldtrump .@cardinaldolan thank you for a great call yesterday with catholic leaders, and a great service today from @stpatsnyc!
@realdonaldtrump happy birthday to melania, our great first lady!
@realdonaldtrump had a great call with catholic leaders and educators earlier today. i will be online tomorrow at 10:15 a.m. (eastern) for sunday mass celebrated by @cardinaldolan at st. patrickâ€™s cathedral (@stpatsnyc) in new york city. join me: https://saintpatrickscathedral.org/liveâ pic.twitter.com/iqy5ih5lk6
@realdonaldtrump i will be having a white house press conference today at 5:30 p.m. thank you!
@realdonaldtrump why should the people and taxpayers of america be bailing out poorly run states (like illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? i am open to discussing anything, but just asking?
@realdonaldtrump fake news, the enemy of the people!
@realdonaldtrump there has never been, in the history of our country, a more vicious or hostile lamestream media than there is right now, even in the midst of a national emergency, the invisible enemy!
@realdonaldtrump blame the democrats for any â€ślatenessâ€ť in your enhanced unemployment insurance. i wanted the money to be paid directly, they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. i told them this would happen, especially with many states which have old computers.
@realdonaldtrump so true! https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1254172638307586049â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump american citizens! we were long ahead of dems, who were all against the ban. https://twitter.com/donaldjtrumpjr/status/1254409196998725633â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump great! https://twitter.com/kayajones/status/1254399408009068544â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump they are one of the worst in the â€śnewsâ€ť business. total slime balls! https://twitter.com/presssec/status/1254460454971342854â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump they asked me to be at west point on june 13th., & i will be there! https://twitter.com/davidjurban/status/1254476433667297282â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump laura, just another fake news report! https://twitter.com/ingrahamangle/status/1254539514699304960â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump but i love diamond & silk, and so do millions of people! https://twitter.com/diamondandsilk/status/1254951865831370753â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump texas to open businesses in phases beginning friday. great job being done by @gregabbott_tx
@realdonaldtrump many states moving to safely & quickly reopen!
@realdonaldtrump we are doing far more, and better, testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain. no matter how good a job is done, the same as with the ventilators, they will never say we are doing a great job, they will only viciously gripe!
@realdonaldtrump because shifty is a crooked politician! https://twitter.com/jim_jordan/status/1254774339527835650â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump no, i think amash would make a wonderful candidate, especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his congressional seat. he almost always votes for the do nothing dems anyway. i like him even more than jill stein! https://twitter.com/therickwilson/status/1255485246054809608â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump thank you @marklevinshow! pic.twitter.com/gjsnm0luqh
@realdonaldtrump at least they admit it. the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost never correct their fake reporting! https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/1255161727706116096â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump the only reason the u.s. has reported one million cases of coronavirus is that our testing is sooo much better than any other country in the world. other countries are way behind us in testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!
@realdonaldtrump thank you michael! @bittyandbeaus pic.twitter.com/kvxvcdo79e
@realdonaldtrump over 120 million economic impact payments have already gone out to hardworking americans! if you havenâ€™t yet received your payment, go to http://irs.govâ and click on â€śget my paymentâ€ť to receive your money fast!
@realdonaldtrump we canâ€™t let the fake news, and their partner, the radical left, do nothing democrats, get away with stealing the election. they tried that in 2016. how did that work out?
@realdonaldtrump the do nothing democrats! https://twitter.com/gopleader/status/1255553758253256704â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump fake news! https://twitter.com/@realdonaldtrump/status/1255706636972363776â â€¦

@realdonaldtrump dirty cop james comey got caught!
@realdonaldtrump plus many! https://twitter.com/tomfitton/status/1255676634721632256â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump really? have you looked at the numbers lately! https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/1255798948461187073â â€¦
@realdonaldtrump fake polling, just like 2016 (but worse)!
@realdonaldtrump what happened to general michael flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the united states again!
@realdonaldtrump does anybody really believe that roger stone, a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting fbi agents (with fake news @cnn closely in toe), was treated fairly. how about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred & bias. same scammers as general flynn!
@realdonaldtrump despite reports to the contrary, sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. as of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of norway (207), finland (206) or denmark (443). the united states made the correct decision!
@realdonaldtrump lyinâ€™ brian williams of msdnc! pic.twitter.com/3gtkdmozjj
@realdonaldtrump i must admit that lyinâ€™ brian williams is, while dumber than hell, quite a bit smarter than fake news @cnn â€śanchormanâ€ť don lemon, the â€śdumbest man on televisionâ€ť. then you have psycho joe â€śwhat ever happened to your girlfriend?â€ť scarborough, another of the low i.q. individuals!
@realdonaldtrump lyinâ€™ brian williams of msdnc, a concast scam company, wouldnâ€™t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? totally made up story. heâ€™s a true dummy who was thrown off network news like a dog. stay tuned!
@realdonaldtrump just told that fake news @cnn is falsely reporting that i was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. actually, he is doing a great job, i never shouted at him (been with me for years, including the 2016 win), & have no intention to do so. just fake news!
@realdonaldtrump .@cnn doesnâ€™t want to speak about their persecution of general michael flynn & why they got the story so wrong. they, along with others, should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man & his family. they wonâ€™t even cover the big breaking news about this scam!
@realdonaldtrump happy birthday to three time olympian and five term congressman, @jimryun!
