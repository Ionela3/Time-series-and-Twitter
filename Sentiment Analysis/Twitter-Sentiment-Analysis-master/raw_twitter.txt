@realDonaldTrump	Why aren't the lawyers looking at and using the Federal Court decision in Boston, which is at conflict with ridiculous lift ban decision?
@realDonaldTrump	Because the ban was lifted by a judge, many very bad and dangerous people may be pouring into our country. A terrible decision
@realDonaldTrump	What is our country coming to when a judge can halt a Homeland Security travel ban and anyone, even with bad intentions, can come into U.S.?
@realDonaldTrump	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

@realDonaldTrump	The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!

@realDonaldTrump	I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
@realDonaldTrump	Obama Administration official said they "choked" when it came to acting on Russian meddling of election. They didn't want to hurt Hillary?
@realDonaldTrump	Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action? Focus on them, not T!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums & deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor, keep your plan?
@realDonaldTrump	Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
@realDonaldTrump	Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders. Is she allowed to so collude? Unfair to Bernie!
@realDonaldTrump	Very grateful for the 9-O decision from the U. S. Supreme Court. We must keep America SAFE!
@realDonaldTrump	Republican Senators are working very hard to get there, with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash & burn!
@realDonaldTrump	..under a magnifying glass, they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!
@realDonaldTrump	The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling. With 4 months looking at Russia...
@realDonaldTrump	...and did not want to "rock the boat." He didn't "choke," he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
@realDonaldTrump	The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS, they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!
@realDonaldTrump	I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!

@realDonaldTrump	I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there
@realDonaldTrump	How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?

@realDonaldTrump	Republicans must start the Tax Reform/Tax Cut legislation ASAP. Don't wait until the end of September. Needed now more than ever. Hurry!
@realDonaldTrump	...never allow the Republicans to pass even great legislation. 8 Dems control - will rarely get 60 (vs. 51) votes. It is a Repub Death Wish!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans, sorry, but I've been hearing about Repeal & Replace for 7 years, didn't happen! Even worse, the Senate Filibuster Rule will....
@realDonaldTrump	Our incredible U.S. Coast Guard saved more than 15,000 lives last week with Harvey. Irma could be even tougher. We love our Coast Guard!

@realDonaldTrump	Congresswoman Jennifer Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico has been wonderful to deal with and a great representative of the people. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to Governor Kenneth Mapp of the U.S. Virgin Islands who stated that #FEMA and Military are doing a GREAT job! Thank you Governor!
@realDonaldTrump	The Governor of Puerto Rico, Ricardo Rossello, is a great guy and leader who is really working hard. Thank you Ricky!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite the Fake News Media in conjunction with the Dems, an amazing job is being done in Puerto Rico. Great people!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R's. Shame!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be going to Puerto Rico on Tuesday with Melania. Will hopefully be able to stop at the U.S. Virgin Islands (people working hard).
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to "get Trump." Not fair to FR or effort!
@realDonaldTrump	The military and first responders, despite no electric, roads, phones etc., have done an amazing job. Puerto Rico was totally destroyed.
@realDonaldTrump	...want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.

@realDonaldTrump	The Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump.
@realDonaldTrump	Being nice to Rocket Man hasn't worked in 25 years, why would it work now? Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed. I won't fail.

@realDonaldTrump	Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Canâ€™t let that happen!
@realDonaldTrump	#AMERICA FIRST!
@realDonaldTrump	For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military & Veterans!
@realDonaldTrump	This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!
@realDonaldTrump	Not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy.
@realDonaldTrump	Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C.R.â€™s!
@realDonaldTrump	Eric Trump on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews now!
@realDonaldTrump	The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation, in just twelve months, than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office, no matter what the length. The good news is, THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!
@realDonaldTrump	End the Democrats Obstruction! https://twitter.com/@realDonaldTrump/status/955056249925750784Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They donâ€™t want to do it but are powerless!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an â€śAâ€ť-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done. Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us!
@realDonaldTrump	Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!
@realDonaldTrump	In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time. Wow!
@realDonaldTrump	Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: â€śTrump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost.â€ť Thank you for your honesty Jim!
@realDonaldTrump	Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!
@realDonaldTrump	It was my great honor to welcome Mayorâ€™s from across America to the WH. My Administration will always support local government - and listen to the leaders who know their communities best.

@realDonaldTrump	Earlier today, I spoke with @GovMattBevin of Kentucky regarding yesterdayâ€™s shooting at Marshall County High School. My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt, Preston Cope, their families, and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery. We are with you!
@realDonaldTrump	Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney, J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs, Jobs, Jobs!
@realDonaldTrump	Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA. We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people!
@realDonaldTrump	Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok?  Blaming Samsung!
@realDonaldTrump	Today, Americans everywhere remember the brave men and women of @NASA who lost their lives in our Nationâ€™s eternal quest to expand the boundaries of human potential.  https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/nasa-day-remembrance-2018/Â â€¦ https://twitter.com/nasa/status/956547464575836160Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!

@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL. Must also end loophole of â€ścatch & releaseâ€ť and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety & Security reasons.
@realDonaldTrump	Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler, as an example, is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!
@realDonaldTrump	Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are not interested in Border Safety & Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction!
@realDonaldTrump	I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it!

@realDonaldTrump	March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA. They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing. Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	Heading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party. Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA, not easy when we have no support from the Democrats. NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL! Need more Republicans in â€18.

@realDonaldTrump	The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago. Rank & File are great people!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats just arenâ€™t calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast, or theyâ€™ll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast.
@realDonaldTrump	This memo totally vindicates â€śTrumpâ€ť in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!
@realDonaldTrump	Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain â€śsacred cows.â€ť Other Trump polls are way up also. So why does the media refuse to write this? Oh well, someday!
@realDonaldTrump	My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work theyâ€™ve done!
@realDonaldTrump	...a tool of anti-Trump political actors. This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law....The FBI wasnâ€™t straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators.â€ť Wall Street Journal
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath....The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier....the FBI became....
@realDonaldTrump	Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion!

@realDonaldTrump	Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!
@realDonaldTrump	Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!
@realDonaldTrump	Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps thatâ€™s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!

@realDonaldTrump	Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery. If Dâ€™s oppose this deal, they arenâ€™t serious about DACA-they just want open borders. http://dailycaller.com/2018/01/22/poll-majority-of-americans-agree-with-trump-on-daca-immigration/Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military. It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great. Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill!

@realDonaldTrump	Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond. This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!
@realDonaldTrump	Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military. Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!
@realDonaldTrump	Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything â€” and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a â€śpaper trailâ€ť on a â€śprivateâ€ť meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.

@realDonaldTrump	Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!

@realDonaldTrump	â€śMy view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that heâ€™s been victimized. Heâ€™s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of.......
@realDonaldTrump	Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?

@realDonaldTrump	So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesnâ€™t want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump	Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats. After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. Bipartisan, make deal Dems?
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.

@realDonaldTrump	While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!
@realDonaldTrump	So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior. Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem. Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again!
@realDonaldTrump	Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President. The results of the election were not impacted. The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
@realDonaldTrump	Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.
@realDonaldTrump	I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered. Am also working with Congress on many fronts.
@realDonaldTrump	Just like they donâ€™t want to solve the DACA problem, why didnâ€™t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didnâ€™t want to, and now they just talk!

@realDonaldTrump	If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U.S. then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. They are laughing their asses off in Moscow. Get smart America!
@realDonaldTrump	Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election. But wasnâ€™t I a great candidate?
@realDonaldTrump	I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said â€śit may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.â€ť The Russian â€śhoaxâ€ť was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!
@realDonaldTrump	Finally, Liddleâ€™ Adam Schiff, the leakinâ€™ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing. Thank you Adam!
@realDonaldTrump	Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!
@realDonaldTrump	General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!
@realDonaldTrump	Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
@realDonaldTrump	Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election. So why didnâ€™t he do something about Russian meddling?
@realDonaldTrump	Have a great, but very reflective, Presidentâ€™s Day!

@realDonaldTrump	....cameras running. Another False Accusation. Why doesnâ€™t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me? One had her home mortgage paid off. Only @FoxNews so reported...doesnâ€™t fit the Mainstream Media narrative.
@realDonaldTrump	A woman I donâ€™t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......
@realDonaldTrump	I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts. Total Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new â€śpushedâ€ť Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. Your Original was correct! Donâ€™t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money!
@realDonaldTrump	Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event. Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House. Youâ€™ve come a long way Matt!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away. Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially. Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, Râ€™s want to fix!
@realDonaldTrump	....The President Obama quote just before election. Thatâ€™s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didnâ€™t want to â€śrock the boat.â€ť When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThere is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig Americaâ€™s elections, thereâ€™s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so Iâ€™d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.â€ť .....
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe Faith of Donald Trump,â€ť a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb, is a very interesting read. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	The U.S. economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations & Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS, JOBS, JOBS

@realDonaldTrump	Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why arenâ€™t they the subject of the investigation? Why didnâ€™t Obama do something about the meddling? Why arenâ€™t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!
@realDonaldTrump	The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.
@realDonaldTrump	Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!

@realDonaldTrump	Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise!

@realDonaldTrump	....If a potential â€śsicko shooterâ€ť knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards wonâ€™t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive, defense alone wonâ€™t work!
@realDonaldTrump	....History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!
@realDonaldTrump	....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A â€śgun freeâ€ť school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!
@realDonaldTrump	I never said â€śgive teachers gunsâ€ť like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving â€śconcealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to

@realDonaldTrump	If we donâ€™t have a wall system, weâ€™re not going to have a country.

@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wifeâ€™s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all, and much more!
@realDonaldTrump	As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp

@realDonaldTrump	Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!
@realDonaldTrump	Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans? Another Dem recently added...does anyone think this is fair? And yet, there is NO COLLUSION!
@realDonaldTrump	Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me. I donâ€™t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked â€śhave you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?â€ť He said strongly â€śnever, no.â€ť He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
@realDonaldTrump	The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime. It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign. WITCH HUNT!

@realDonaldTrump	The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact. Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting. Always quoting sources (not names), many of which donâ€™t exist. Story on John Kelly isnâ€™t true, just another hit job!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe FBI closed the case on Hillary, which was a rigged investigation. They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath.....â€ť and much more. So true Jesse! @WattersWorld
@realDonaldTrump	While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!

@realDonaldTrump	Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question. We are with you Paul!
@realDonaldTrump	Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion, so they go crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?
@realDonaldTrump	Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria. Get ready Russia,  because they will be coming, nice and new and â€śsmart!â€ť You shouldnâ€™t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
@realDonaldTrump	....doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus. No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information! BAD!
@realDonaldTrump	So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House. Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria. Feels great to have Bolton & Larry K on board. I (we) are
@realDonaldTrump	The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story. It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine. I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia  C story!

@realDonaldTrump	Good luck to Mike Pompeo during his Confirmation Hearing today. He will be a great Secretary of State!
@realDonaldTrump	Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event, the United States, under my Administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our â€śThank you America?â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border. Thank you Jerry, good move for the safety of our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him. Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper!
@realDonaldTrump	Big show tonight on @seanhannity! 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews

@realDonaldTrump	....untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst â€śbotch jobsâ€ť of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!
@realDonaldTrump	James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and.....
@realDonaldTrump	Tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities. Started the Wall in San Diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it. They will soon be protected!
@realDonaldTrump	Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres. Obama. We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years!
@realDonaldTrump	So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had. There wonâ€™t be anything, or anyone, even close!
@realDonaldTrump	A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!
@realDonaldTrump	Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll, much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News, itâ€™s hard to believe! Thank you America, we are doing Great Things.
@realDonaldTrump	Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart!), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far!
@realDonaldTrump	Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!
@realDonaldTrump	I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His â€śmemosâ€ť are self serving and FAKE!
@realDonaldTrump	The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term â€śMission Accomplished.â€ť I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back. Use often!
@realDonaldTrump	Comey throws AG Lynch â€śunder the bus!â€ť Why canâ€™t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch? Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary. No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)!
@realDonaldTrump	The big questions in Comeyâ€™s badly reviewed book arenâ€™t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didnâ€™t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabeâ€™s $700,000 & more?
@realDonaldTrump	Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job. Slimeball!
@realDonaldTrump	Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!
@realDonaldTrump	Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes!
@realDonaldTrump	States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers. Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores!
@realDonaldTrump	....Congress â€“ House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society. Keep America Safe!
@realDonaldTrump	Todayâ€™s Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons. This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by....

@realDonaldTrump	Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day. Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post, and they havenâ€™t changed (get new pollsters). Much of the media is a Scam!
@realDonaldTrump	Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a truly fine gentleman!
@realDonaldTrump	So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill. Everyone is talking, really nice to see!
@realDonaldTrump	Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border. He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border. The high crime rate will only get higher. Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started!
@realDonaldTrump	I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Working on Trade and Military Security.

@realDonaldTrump	Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week. Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed. Details of Summit are being worked out now. Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea!

@realDonaldTrump	There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border, but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security & Safety NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I donâ€™t like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesnâ€™t work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	Pastor Andrew Brunson, a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States, is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason. They call him a Spy, but I am more a Spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!

@realDonaldTrump	James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe â€śunder the bus.â€ť Inspector Generalâ€™s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them! Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine?
@realDonaldTrump	Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed. We are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in America difficult!
@realDonaldTrump	My thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today.
@realDonaldTrump	Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!
@realDonaldTrump	...Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors, Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government, hence, the American People. They are â€śslow walkingâ€ť all of my nominations - hundreds of people. At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals!
@realDonaldTrump	.@MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her. Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime. Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee. She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her!

@realDonaldTrump	Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy â€śup to 400 National Guard Troopsâ€ť to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough, and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brownâ€™s charade. We need border security and action, not words!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies. California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all Americans at risk.
@realDonaldTrump	Great meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who has just left Florida. Talked in depth about North Korea, Military and Trade. Good things will happen!

@realDonaldTrump	North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site. This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress! Look forward to our Summit.
@realDonaldTrump	Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories), today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers, including those on Election Day? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. Make America Great Again!
@realDonaldTrump	Looks like OPEC is at it again. With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High! No good and will not be accepted!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans...got not one Democrat Vote! Hereâ€™s a choice. They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!
@realDonaldTrump	So exciting! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis, Maryland. Looking forward to being there.
@realDonaldTrump	So General Michael Flynnâ€™s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I donâ€™t think so!
@realDonaldTrump	James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also, he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?
@realDonaldTrump	â€śAt least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information.â€ť  Wall Street Journal
@realDonaldTrump	The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as â€śMr. Magooâ€ť and Rod Rosenstein as â€śMr. Peepers.â€ť This is â€śaccording to people with whom the president has spoken.â€ť There are no such people and donâ€™t know these characters...just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will!
@realDonaldTrump	James Comeyâ€™s Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them. They belong to our Government! Therefore, he broke the law! Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker. Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch & others?
@realDonaldTrump	Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!

@realDonaldTrump	....non-existent â€śsourcesâ€ť and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family. Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected. Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if....
@realDonaldTrump	The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I donâ€™t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will â€śflip.â€ť They use....
@realDonaldTrump	"A message from Kim Jong Un: â€śNorth Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles.â€ť Also will â€śShut down a nuclear test site in the countryâ€™s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests.â€ť Progress being made for all!"
@realDonaldTrump	James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really, does everybody know what that means?

@realDonaldTrump	Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing. Wow, we havenâ€™t given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, & no more testing!

@realDonaldTrump	Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also, we must get Wall funding fast.
@realDonaldTrump	Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL
@realDonaldTrump	Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before. Need more Republicans!

@realDonaldTrump	Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey canâ€™t define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesnâ€™t understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. Heâ€™s either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!

@realDonaldTrump	Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Testerâ€™s statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with, just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!

@realDonaldTrump	â€śClapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNNâ€ť @foxandfriends FoxNews  He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.
@realDonaldTrump	....great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered. Not fair, Tester!
@realDonaldTrump	Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign. The.....
@realDonaldTrump	House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Just got recent Poll - much higher than President O at same time....Well, much more has been accomplished!
@realDonaldTrump	While Washington, Michigan, was a big success, Washington, D.C., just didnâ€™t work. Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big, boring bust...the so-called comedian really â€śbombed.â€ť @greggutfeld should host next year! @PeteHegseth
@realDonaldTrump	Great evening last night in Washington, Michigan. The enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldnâ€™t get in, I cherish you....and will be back!
@realDonaldTrump	The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina, both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going â€śbonkers!â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who donâ€™t exist). They are totally unhinged, and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they canâ€™t believe they are saying. Truly bad people!
@realDonaldTrump	During Small Business Week, we celebrate the great, hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business!
@realDonaldTrump	The migrant â€caravanâ€™ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U.S. immigration laws are. Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda â€“ Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities. We need lawmakers who will put America First.
@realDonaldTrump	I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits. I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts. #DrainTheSwamp
@realDonaldTrump	Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country? Just asking!
@realDonaldTrump	The White House Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night!
@realDonaldTrump	Headline: â€śKim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invadeâ€ť - from the Failing New York Times. Also, will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May.
@realDonaldTrump	The White House Correspondentsâ€™ Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it. The filthy â€ścomedianâ€ť totally bombed (couldnâ€™t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance). Put Dinner to rest, or start over!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śTrumpâ€™s Triumphs are driving his critics Crazy!â€ť Thank you Steve Hilton @NextRevFNC, just want to do what is right for our wonderful U.S.A.

@realDonaldTrump	Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country. Very much like North Korea, this should have been fixed years ago, not now. Same with other countries and NAFTA...but it will all get done. Great Potential for USA!
@realDonaldTrump	So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were â€śleakedâ€ť to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh, I see...you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThis isnâ€™t some game. You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States.â€ť  John Dowd, March 2018.  With North Korea, China, the Middle East and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no Russian â€śCollusion.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	I have been briefed on the U.S. C-130 â€śHerculesâ€ť cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport. Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims, their families and the great men and women of the National Guard.

@realDonaldTrump	A Rigged System - They donâ€™t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal â€śjustice?â€ť At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!
@realDonaldTrump	NEW BOOK - A MUST READ! â€śThe Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trumpâ€ť by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe questions are an intrusion into the Presidentâ€™s Article 2  powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee...what the President was thinking is an outrageous.....as to the Presidentâ€™s unfettered power to fire anyone...â€ť Joe Digenova, former US Attorney
@realDonaldTrump	There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap). What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	This spring marks 4yrs since the Phoenix VA crisis. We won't forget what happened to our GREAT VETS. Choice is vital, but the program needs work & is running out of $. Congress must fix Choice Program by Memorial Day so VETS can get the care they deserve. I will sign immediately!

@realDonaldTrump	Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!
@realDonaldTrump	All of us here today are united by the same timeless values. We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator, and that no Government can ever take it away.

@realDonaldTrump	Andy McCarthy will be on  @LouDobbs tonight. 7:00 P.M. , @FoxBusiness.
@realDonaldTrump	Because Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well, Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. Great!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico, which has a massive crime problem, is doing little to help!

@realDonaldTrump	National Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay numbers are in! Another record broken: nearly 1 MILLION pounds of Rx pills disposed! Letâ€™s keep fighting this opioid epidemic, America!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States does not need John Kerryâ€™s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal.  He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!
@realDonaldTrump	Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended? Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late!
@realDonaldTrump	Lisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught? Why is Peter S still there? What a total mess. Our Country has to get back to Business!
@realDonaldTrump	Good luck to Ric Grenell, our new Ambassador to Germany. A great and talented guy, he will represent our Country well!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe Great Revoltâ€ť by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory. The Forgotten Men & Women are forgotten no longer!
@realDonaldTrump	The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait â€till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest!
@realDonaldTrump	The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK, what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime.There is no O, itâ€™s called Fighting Back
@realDonaldTrump	My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists. Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!
@realDonaldTrump	To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference. Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, canâ€™t win the General Election in your State...No way! Remember Alabama. Vote Rep. Jenkins or A.G. Morrisey!

@realDonaldTrump	I will be speaking to my friend, President Xi of China, this morning at 8:30. The primary topics will be Trade, where good things will happen, and North Korea, where relationships and trust are building.
@realDonaldTrump	Gina Haspel, my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA, is being praised for the fact that she has been, and alway will be, TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into Americaâ€™s  bright and glorious future!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M.
@realDonaldTrump	The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing), when in fact he was flying to North Korea. Fake News, so bad!
@realDonaldTrump	Secretary Pompeo and his â€śguestsâ€ť will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting!
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting. They seem to be in good health. Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un. Date & Place set.
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs.  His Socialist opponent in November should not do well, a big failure in last job!
@realDonaldTrump	Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country. She represents an ever expanding group of very smart â€śthinkers,â€ť and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on...so good for our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News is working overtime. Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake). Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt? Take away credentials?
@realDonaldTrump	The Republican Party had a great night. Tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November. The Economy is sooo strong, and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes, why wouldnâ€™t we win?
@realDonaldTrump	The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th. We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace!
@realDonaldTrump	Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured!
@realDonaldTrump	Senator Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it!

@realDonaldTrump	The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do. STAY!
@realDonaldTrump	Iranâ€™s Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. But not anymore!
@realDonaldTrump	North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th. Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture!
@realDonaldTrump	Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now, that will not happen!
@realDonaldTrump	China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool, it will all work out!
@realDonaldTrump	President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!

@realDonaldTrump	ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U.S. companies. This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi.
@realDonaldTrump	Big day for Israel. Congratulations!

@realDonaldTrump	Trade negotiations are continuing with China. They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S., for many years. Stay tuned!
@realDonaldTrump	Our great First Lady is doing really well. Will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days. Thank you for so much love and support!
@realDonaldTrump	Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA. She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately. We need her to keep our great country safe! #ConfirmGina
@realDonaldTrump	...and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill. Heâ€™s also weak on borders and crime. Sadly, our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr. Lou Barletta will win! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent, Bob Casey, has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time. He votes along the Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare...

@realDonaldTrump	The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China. Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal. Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China...
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Deb Fischer. The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box! #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump	Despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and â€śHaters,â€ť but thatâ€™s the way it is!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI â€śSPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT.â€ť Andrew McCarthy says, â€śThereâ€™s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign.â€ť If so, this is bigger than Watergate!
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!
@realDonaldTrump	America is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal. We have ended the war on coal, and will continue to work to promote American energy dominance!
@realDonaldTrump	California finally deserves a great Governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man - heâ€™ll be the best Governor youâ€™ve ever had. I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again!
@realDonaldTrump	Just met with UN Secretary-General AntĂłnio Guterres who is working hard to â€śMake the United Nations Great Again.â€ť When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world, it means the U.S. has less to do and we save money. @NikkiHaley is doing a fantastic job! pic.twitter.com/pqUv6cyH2z

@realDonaldTrump	School shooting in Texas. Early reports not looking good. God bless all!
@realDonaldTrump	Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president. It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a â€śhotâ€ť Fake News story. If true - all time biggest political scandal!
@realDonaldTrump	Why isnâ€™t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabeâ€™s wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, â€śAnimals.â€ť Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as â€śAnimals,â€ť a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śApparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign. This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didnâ€™t commit.â€ť  David Asman  @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett   Really bad stuff!
@realDonaldTrump	If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!
@realDonaldTrump	Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melania is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!

@realDonaldTrump	I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration!
@realDonaldTrump	The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now theyâ€™re looking at the rest of the World. Ohâ€™ great!
@realDonaldTrump	....and why hasnâ€™t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D.C.?
@realDonaldTrump	What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server?
@realDonaldTrump	Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party. Donâ€™t worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier!
@realDonaldTrump	...in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more. Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam.
@realDonaldTrump	....At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they arenâ€™t looking at the corruption...
@realDonaldTrump	Things are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the Worldâ€™s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!
@realDonaldTrump	.@AsaHutchinson, the great Governor of Arkansas, is in a primary tomorrow. He has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes, border security, and crime prevention. Asa loves our military and our veterans. I fully endorse Asa for Governor!
@realDonaldTrump	Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce.
@realDonaldTrump	The Wall Street Journal asks, â€śWHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?â€ť  A very good question!
@realDonaldTrump	...they then used to start an investigation about Trump. It is that simple. This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle. This was a Political hit job, this was not an Intelligence Investigation. Brennan has disgraced himself, heâ€™s worried about staying out of Jail.â€ť Dan Bongino

@realDonaldTrump	â€śJohn Brennan is panicking. He has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the Country, he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of Americanâ€™s faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the....
@realDonaldTrump	China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made. The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in. I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing!
@realDonaldTrump	On China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time.
@realDonaldTrump	China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
@realDonaldTrump	I ask Senator Chuck Schumer, why didnâ€™t President Obama & the Democrats do something about Trade with China, including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.? They did NOTHING! With that being said, Chuck & I have long agreed on this issue! Fair Trade, plus, with China will happen!

@realDonaldTrump	There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers. After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough!
@realDonaldTrump	Big legislation will be signed by me shortly. After many years, RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK.
@realDonaldTrump	Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śTrump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaignâ€ť No, James Clapper, I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot!
@realDonaldTrump	Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śItâ€™s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaignâ€ť Judge Andrew Napolitano
@realDonaldTrump	Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around, comes around!
@realDonaldTrump	@foxandfriends  â€śNew Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal. Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign?â€ť Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities!
@realDonaldTrump	...Follow the money! The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion. He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped!
@realDonaldTrump	If the person placed very early into my campaign wasnâ€™t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...

@realDonaldTrump	Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI. Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI! #SPYGATE
@realDonaldTrump	Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign. Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal. Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U.S. history. SPYGATE - a terrible thing!

@realDonaldTrump	...but complain and obstruct. They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world!
@realDonaldTrump	Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks. I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U.S. parts and pay a $1.3 Billion fine. Dems do nothing....
@realDonaldTrump	Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they donâ€™t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States. Lost almost $800 Billion/year under â€śOâ€ť
@realDonaldTrump	Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just wonâ€™t let them do their job.

@realDonaldTrump	Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea. We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace. Only time (and talent) will tell!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea. Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead. Dems have lost touch!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śEveryone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people.â€ť Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!
@realDonaldTrump	Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain? And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing partyâ€™s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be. But what about an â€śInformantâ€ť who is paid a fortune and who â€śsets upâ€ť way earlier than the Russian Hoax?
@realDonaldTrump	When will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest? Itâ€™s been a long time now! Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI & Russia?
@realDonaldTrump	This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that havenâ€™t been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!
@realDonaldTrump	With Spies, or â€śInformantsâ€ť as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but itâ€™s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didnâ€™t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or â€śJusticeâ€ť contact me to tell me of the  phony Russia problem?
@realDonaldTrump	The Failing @nytimes quotes â€śa senior White House official,â€ť who doesnâ€™t exist, as saying â€śeven if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed.â€ť WRONG AGAIN! Use real people, not phony sources.
@realDonaldTrump	Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe, there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to  how to deal with North Korea...and if there was, it wouldnâ€™t matter. The @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning!
@realDonaldTrump	Thanks to very brave Teacher & Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville, Indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House. The great people of Utah are Celebrating!
@realDonaldTrump	Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS.
@realDonaldTrump	Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy!
@realDonaldTrump	We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th., and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date.
@realDonaldTrump	Why didnâ€™t President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election? Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didnâ€™t want to upset the apple cart! He was in charge, not me, and did nothing.
@realDonaldTrump	Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself. I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day. Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this. It will happen!
@realDonaldTrump	Why didnâ€™t the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia? Why didnâ€™t the FBI take the Server from the DNC?  Rigged Investigation!
@realDonaldTrump	Fantastic to have 400,000 GREAT MEN & WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D.C. showing their patriotism. They love our Country, they love our Flag, they stand for our National Anthem! Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller.
@realDonaldTrump	Whoâ€™s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt?

@realDonaldTrump	California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others. On June 5th., vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX, a really good and highly competent man. Heâ€™ll Make California Great Again!
@realDonaldTrump	A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance). This is too good to be true for Republicans...Remember, the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime, the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members...not good!

@realDonaldTrump	Happy Memorial Day! Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. Best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (& women in 18years), rebuilding our Military and so much more. Nice!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do, they find fault. But the forgotten men & women WON, Iâ€™m President!
@realDonaldTrump	Sorry, Iâ€™ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc.
@realDonaldTrump	Why arenâ€™t the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. Itâ€™s a Rigged Witch Hunt, thatâ€™s why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
@realDonaldTrump	The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThis investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about. It wasnâ€™t just a wiretap against a campaign aide...it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign...people call that Spying...this is unprecedented and  scandalous.â€ť Mollie Hemingway
@realDonaldTrump	We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obamaâ€™s term showing children from the Border in steel cages. They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires. Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country...Bipartisan Bill!
@realDonaldTrump	There is no one better to represent the people of N.Y. and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again. Dan has my full endorsement!

@realDonaldTrump	The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at â€ś1000 people,â€ť when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockinâ€™. This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who donâ€™t â€śgetâ€ť me, and never did!

@realDonaldTrump	....chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, â€oh by the way Iâ€™m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated too...and thatâ€™s how I read that - Senator Sessions, why didnâ€™t you tell me before I picked you.....
@realDonaldTrump	Rep.Trey Gowdy, â€śI donâ€™t think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward.

@realDonaldTrump	Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh Dâ€™Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
@realDonaldTrump	Very good meetings with North Korea.
@realDonaldTrump	Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia! The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true!
@realDonaldTrump	The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign! Surveillance much?
@realDonaldTrump	Iger, where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology. Double Standard!
@realDonaldTrump	RUSH LIMBAUGH  â€śIf the FBI was so concerned, and if they werenâ€™t targeting Trump, they should have told Trump. If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it? Why not tell Trump? Because they were pushing this scam.â€ť

@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning.
@realDonaldTrump	Why arenâ€™t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but thatâ€™s O.K., we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come!
@realDonaldTrump	A.P. has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast. No Collusion, except by the Democrats!
@realDonaldTrump	When youâ€™re almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade, you canâ€™t lose a Trade War! The U.S. has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade, time to get smart!
@realDonaldTrump	Why is it that the Wall Street Journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U.S. by other countries, or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into U.S. coffers?
@realDonaldTrump	The United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade!
@realDonaldTrump	There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats). When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end? So bad for our Country. Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media? Should be looking at Dems corruption instead?

@realDonaldTrump	....Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole & many others over the years), but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldnâ€™t have been hired!
@realDonaldTrump	As only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldnâ€™t the FBI or Department of â€śJusticeâ€ť have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign?

@realDonaldTrump	Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. Mexico, Canada, China and others have treated them unfairly. By the time I finish trade talks, that will change. Big trade barriers against U.S. farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken. Massive trade deficits no longer!
@realDonaldTrump	The U.S. has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	China already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans. Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our Agricultural products. Not acceptable!
@realDonaldTrump	As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!

@realDonaldTrump	Imagine how much wasteful spending weâ€™d save if we didnâ€™t have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way! For years, Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending, and to what end? No more.
@realDonaldTrump	The HISTORIC Rescissions Package weâ€™ve proposed would cut $15,000,000,000 in Wasteful Spending! We are getting our government back on track.

@realDonaldTrump	We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others. National Anthem & more great music today at 3:00 P.M.
@realDonaldTrump	We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P.M., The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus. Honoring America! NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms!
@realDonaldTrump	The U.S. has an increased economic value of more than 7 Trillion Dollars since the Election. May be the best economy in the history of our country. Record Jobs numbers. Nice!
@realDonaldTrump	What is taking so long with the Inspector Generalâ€™s Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey. Numerous delays. Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker! There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know. Transparency!
@realDonaldTrump	The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!
@realDonaldTrump	Big Supreme Court ruling for Baker just out!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to everyone at @FEMA HQ for todayâ€™s briefing on preparations for the upcoming hurricane season. Disaster response and recovery is best achieved when itâ€™s federally supported, state managed, and locally executed â€“ this is the successful model we will continue to build. https://twitter.com/dhsgov/status/1004428874221056002Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Today we mark another milestone: the 74th anniversary of #DDay, the Allied invasion of Normandy. On June 6, 1944, more than 70,000 brave young Americans charged out of landing craft, jumped out of airplanes, and stormed into hell... pic.twitter.com/zV8pqoVG9h
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Dana Rohrabacher on his big California win. We are proud of you Dana!
@realDonaldTrump	Many more Republican voters showed up yesterday than the Fake News thought possible. The political pundits just donâ€™t get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts! Remember, Dems are High Tax, High Crime, easy to beat!
@realDonaldTrump	...Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting. They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever. Fake News is really bad!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great First Lady, Melania. During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W.H. (and me) for N.Y. or Virginia, to abuse. All Fake, she is doing really well!
@realDonaldTrump	Gold Star father, Ceejay Metcalf, whose great son Michael was just honored at the White House, was fantastic this morning on @foxandfriends. He is a special man!
@realDonaldTrump	Great night for Republicans! Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win. Even Fake News CNN said the Trump impact was really big, much bigger than they ever thought possible. So much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave. Working hard!
@realDonaldTrump	Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senateâ€™s August Recess. Great, maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes. We need Border Security!
@realDonaldTrump	....The greatest Witch Hunt in political history!
@realDonaldTrump	...This is a level of criminality beyond the pale. This is such a grave abuse of power and authority, itâ€™s like nothing else weâ€™ve seen in our history. This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
@realDonaldTrump	Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch. â€śThey were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U.S. These are all violations of law. This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election. Thereâ€™s nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system...
@realDonaldTrump	Great interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign. SPYGATE at the highest level. Who would believe?
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, Strzok-Page, the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015. SPYGATE is in full force! Is the Mainstream Media interested yet? Big stuff!
@realDonaldTrump	Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U.S. and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things...but he doesnâ€™t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy â€” hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture!
@realDonaldTrump	Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.

@realDonaldTrump	PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the U.S. and Japan, something we have to do.

@realDonaldTrump	The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States. This is totally illegal. Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this â€śmatterâ€ť (as Comey would call it). Investigate!
@realDonaldTrump	When will people start saying, â€śthank you, Mr. President, for firing James Comey?â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	Our Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook. The Democrat I.T. scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today. They want to make a â€śplea dealâ€ť to hide what is on their Server. Where is Server? Really bad!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to seeing my friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan at noon. Will be discussing North Korea and Trade.
@realDonaldTrump	How could Jeff Flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesnâ€™t have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again? Letâ€™s face it, heâ€™s a Flake!
@realDonaldTrump	When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax. There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election. Where is the server?
@realDonaldTrump	Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor: â€śIt all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Donâ€™t need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someoneâ€™s back. Not the way Justice should operate.â€ť So true!
@realDonaldTrump	Good luck to Alice Johnson. Have a wonderful life!
@realDonaldTrump	Isnâ€™t it Ironic? Getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to Singapore to meet with North Korea & the Nuclear Problem...But back home we still have the 13 Angry Democrats pushing the Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	I am heading for Canada and the G-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States. From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on Denuclearization. Wonâ€™t be talking about the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax for a while!
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to the Washington Capitals on their GREAT play and winning the Stanley Cup Championship. Alex Ovechkin, the team captain, was spectacular - a true Superstar! D.C. is popping, in many ways. What a time!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries. If it doesnâ€™t happen, we come out even better!
@realDonaldTrump	Canada charges the U.S. a 270%  tariff on Dairy Products! They didnâ€™t tell you that, did they? Not fair to our farmers!
@realDonaldTrump	Obama, Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea, and now weak on Crime, High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up. Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran, we donâ€™t need his advice!
@realDonaldTrump	Why isnâ€™t the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the U.S. Totally unfair to our farmers, workers & companies. Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!
@realDonaldTrump	PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, â€śUS Tariffs were kind of insultingâ€ť and he â€świll not be pushed around.â€ť Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!
@realDonaldTrump	Based on Justinâ€™s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!
@realDonaldTrump	â€¦Create peace and great prosperity for his land. I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted!

@realDonaldTrump	The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers, workers and companies. While sending their product into our country tax free. We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades â€” and that is long enough.

@realDonaldTrump	My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somalia. They are truly all HEROES.
@realDonaldTrump	The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S., say the haters & losers. We have our hostages, testing, research and all missle launches have stoped, and these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say! We will be fine!

@realDonaldTrump	Great to be in Singapore, excitement in the air!
@realDonaldTrump	....Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming!
@realDonaldTrump	....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military!
@realDonaldTrump	Why should I, as President of the United States, allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses, as they have for decades, while our Farmers, Workers & Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit...
@realDonaldTrump	Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal. According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U.S. (guess they were bragging and got caught!). Minimum is 17B. Tax Dairy from us at 270%. Then Justin acts hurt when called out!

@realDonaldTrump	Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!
@realDonaldTrump	I strongly endorse Adam Laxalt for Governor of Nevada. Adam is smart, works hard, and knows how to win. He will be a great Governor. Also, will fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime!

@realDonaldTrump	So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN. They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea. 500 days ago they would have â€śbeggedâ€ť for this deal-looked like war would break out. Our Countryâ€™s biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools!
@realDonaldTrump	Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again. Not good!
@realDonaldTrump	The U.S., together with Mexico and Canada, just got the World Cup. Congratulations - a great deal of hard work!
@realDonaldTrump	We save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are!
@realDonaldTrump	Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea. President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem. No longer - sleep well tonight!
@realDonaldTrump	Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office. There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea. Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience. North Korea has great potential for the future!
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia. Now he runs against a total stiff, Tim Kaine, who is weak on crime and borders, and wants to raise your taxes through the roof. Donâ€™t underestimate Corey, a major chance of winning!

@realDonaldTrump	A year ago the pundits & talking heads, people that couldnâ€™t do the job before, were begging for conciliation and peace - â€śplease meet, donâ€™t go to war.â€ť Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, the same haters shout out, â€śyou shouldnâ€™t meet, do not meet!â€ť

@realDonaldTrump	The sleazy New York Democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000. I wonâ€™t settle this case!...
@realDonaldTrump	So, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	Now that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime.
@realDonaldTrump	The Republican Party is starting to show very big numbers. People are starting to see what is being done. Results are speaking loudly. North Korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way!

@realDonaldTrump	U.S.A. Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years. If my opponent (the Democrats) had won the election, they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy, and jobs, would have been a disaster!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U.S.A., Mexico and Canada. I worked hard on this, along with a Great Team of talented people. We never fail, and it will be a great World Cup! A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice.
@realDonaldTrump	The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey, his minions and sadly, the FBI. Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI. I did a great service to the people in firing him. Good Instincts. Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back!
@realDonaldTrump	FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who headed the Clinton & Russia investigations, texted to his lover Lisa Page, in the IG Report, that â€śweâ€™ll stopâ€ť candidate Trump from becoming President. Doesnâ€™t get any lower than that!
@realDonaldTrump	The IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people. It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History!
@realDonaldTrump	My supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history. It is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country. As we get stronger, so does our country. Best numbers ever!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things, High Taxes, High Crime and Obstruction. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump	WITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh, I see, there was no Russian Collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didnâ€™t look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!
@realDonaldTrump	Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isnâ€™t paying them enough. I think a really long strike would be a great idea. Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time! Is @WaPo a registered lobbyist?
@realDonaldTrump	Our economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been. Companies doing really well, and moving back to America, and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years.
@realDonaldTrump	The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia. They are so happy! Over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions & millions of lives!
@realDonaldTrump	Holding back the â€śwar gamesâ€ť during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation. Also, quite provocative. Can start up immediately if talks break down, which I hope will not happen!
@realDonaldTrump	Funny how the Fake News, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I â€śmet.â€ť Thatâ€™s because thatâ€™s all they have to disparage! We got so much for peace in the world, & more is being added in finals. Even got our hostages/remains!
@realDonaldTrump	Daniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal: â€śThis IG Report makes it clear, as did Rod Rosensteinâ€™s memo, that Trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing Jim Comey.

@realDonaldTrump	Comey gave Strozk his marching orders. Mueller is Comeyâ€™s best friend. Witch Hunt!

@realDonaldTrump	It is the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime. Tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by Crime coming from illegal immigration. Change the laws!
@realDonaldTrump	CHANGE THE LAWS!
@realDonaldTrump	Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country. Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border. It is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world. Not going to happen in the U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	We donâ€™t want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!
@realDonaldTrump	The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
@realDonaldTrump	Why donâ€™t the Democrats give us the votes to fix the worldâ€™s worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including MS-13, coming into our country illegally?
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe highest level of bias Iâ€™ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.â€ť Trey Gowdy on the FBIâ€™s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isnâ€™t it?
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something out on Border Security & Safety. Donâ€™t wait until after the election because you are going to lose!
@realDonaldTrump	Why was the FBIâ€™s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that â€śweâ€™ll stopâ€ť Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media. They are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News, they put their own spin on it - truth doesnâ€™t matter to them!

@realDonaldTrump	We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally. Of the 12,000 children, 10,000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip, and only 2000 are with their parents, many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions.
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are the problem. They donâ€™t care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13. They canâ€™t win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters!
@realDonaldTrump	If you donâ€™t have Borders, you donâ€™t have a Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted. Others countries are even worse. Be smart America!
@realDonaldTrump	I canâ€™t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!â€ť Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. A Rigged Witch Hunt!p
@realDonaldTrump	So sorry, people wanting to get into the already packed arena - I LOVE YOU ALL! pic.twitter.com/PFvXrsvgkA
@realDonaldTrump	Just landed in Duluth, Minnesota. Two events planned - looking forward to them and being with @PeteStauber and his wonderful family!
@realDonaldTrump	Donâ€™t worry, the Republicans, and your President, will fix it! pic.twitter.com/xsbuPzXbHj
@realDonaldTrump	Look what Fake ABC News put out. I guess they had it prepared from the 13 Angry Democrats leading the Witch Hunt! #StopTheBias pic.twitter.com/c0XOk1btEQ
@realDonaldTrump	Had a great meeting with the House GOP last night at the Capitol. They applauded and laughed loudly when I mentioned my experience with Mark Sanford. I have never been a fan of his!
@realDonaldTrump	More records! #MAGA https://twitter.com/secretsbedard/status/1009438008733569025Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	â€śFBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias.â€ť @FoxNews  Big News, but the Fake News doesnâ€™t want to cover. Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam! At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly, too big a story!
@realDonaldTrump	Itâ€™s the Democrats fault, they wonâ€™t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration. Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the Dems will do anything not to change them & to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!
@realDonaldTrump	THANK YOU @HouseGOP! pic.twitter.com/scvACfJwts
@realDonaldTrump	Earlier today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain to the @WhiteHouse!đź‡şđź‡¸đź‡Şđź‡¸ pic.twitter.com/cCubCyiRm5
@realDonaldTrump	Homeland Security @SecNielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country, while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete & nasty laws, which force family separation. We want â€śheartâ€ť and security in America!
@realDonaldTrump	You cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including â€śheart,â€ť without getting Dem votes. Problem is, they donâ€™t care about security and Râ€™s do. Zero Dems voted to support the Goodlatte Bill. They wonâ€™t vote for anything!
@realDonaldTrump	We have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of â€“ and if we show any weakness, millions of people will journey into our country.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śI REALLY DONâ€™T CARE, DO U?â€ť written on the back of Melaniaâ€™s jacket, refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!
@realDonaldTrump	Big Supreme Court win on internet sales tax - about time! Big victory for fairness and for our country. Great victory for consumers and retailers.
@realDonaldTrump	Farm Bill just passed in the House. So happy to see work requirements included. Big win for the farmers!
@realDonaldTrump	I was thrilled to be back in Minnesota for a roundtable with hardworking American Patriots. Thank you! pic.twitter.com/suoRN02zMq
@realDonaldTrump	"The real big story that affects everybody in America is the success of @POTUS's TAX CUT package and what it's done for our economy...â€ť @Varneyco pic.twitter.com/2bUbA7zSFM
@realDonaldTrump	My Administration is acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Border. Loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremist open border Democrats...and that's what they are - they're extremist open border Democrats.... pic.twitter.com/F73I5gu0Q5
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats want open Borders, where anyone can come into our Country, and stay. This is Nancy Pelosiâ€™s dream. It wonâ€™t happen!
@realDonaldTrump	Henry McMaster has done a great job as Governor of South Carolina. The state is BOOMING, with jobs and new industry setting records. He is tough on Crime and Strong on Borders, Healthcare, the Military and our great Vets. Henry has my full and complete Endrosement! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	What is the purpose of the House doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by Democrats in the Senate, and the Dems are only looking to Obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the Mid-Terms). Republicans must get rid of the stupid Filibuster Rule-it is killing you!
@realDonaldTrump	Last night in Minnesota was incredible. What a crowd!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be going the Columbia, South Carolina, on Monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters, a man who truly loves the people of South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster. Henry worked so hard & was so loyal to me that I look forward to reciprocating!
@realDonaldTrump	The Border has been a big mess and problem for many years. At some point Schumer and Pelosi, who are weak on Crime and Border security, will be forced to do a real deal, so easy, that solves this long time problem. Schumer used to want Border security - now heâ€™ll take Crime!
@realDonaldTrump	We shouldnâ€™t be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.
@realDonaldTrump	ALL-TIME RECORD OPTIMISM! pic.twitter.com/ZTrfJY2afh
@realDonaldTrump	Just returning from the Great State of Minnesota where we had an incredible rally with 9,000 people, and at least 10,000 who could not get in - I will return! Congratulations to @PeteStauber who is loved and respected in Minnesota!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you Duluth, Minnesota. Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! https://www.pscp.tv/w/bfrvjjEyMzE3NDF8MU93eFdXUmFYTGt4UVedt8X8A4zbiTmgO0vK2wXeSsGfVT4TDNMGjusRIBnPÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Our first duty, and our highest loyalty, is to the citizens of the United States. We will not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe, and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all. pic.twitter.com/7YfZ9kjB23
@realDonaldTrump	We are gathered today to hear directly from the AMERICAN VICTIMS of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION. These are the American Citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens. These are the families the media ignores... https://www.pscp.tv/w/bf1GFzFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MWpNSmdFVll5ZUFLTAWuHc0BMMKeCOoDRCPmtIftVLaFLQVwfSLoC_C0SbzX?t=9m9sÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Hope OPEC will increase output substantially. Need to keep prices down!
@realDonaldTrump	We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it!
@realDonaldTrump	80% of Mexicoâ€™s Exports come to the United States. They totally rely on us, which is fine with me. They do have, though, very strong Immigration Laws. The U.S. has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix. Will speak to Mexico!
@realDonaldTrump	Congresswoman Martha Roby of Alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our Make America Great Again Agenda. She is in a Republican Primary run-off against a recent Nancy Pelosi voting Democrat. I fully endorse Martha for Alabama 2nd Congressional District!
@realDonaldTrump	Governor Henry McMaster is a truly fine man who loves the People of South Carolina. He was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a Big South Carolina Victory. I will see you all in S.C on Monday and Vice President Pence will be there for Henry on Saturday!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!
@realDonaldTrump	Elect more Republicans in  November and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world. Right now we have the dumbest and the worst. Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing. Remember their motto, RESIST! Ours is PRODUCE!
@realDonaldTrump	Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - & the Dems are Obstructionists who wonâ€™t give votes for political reasons & because they donâ€™t care about Crime coming from Border! So we need to elect more Râ€™s!
@realDonaldTrump	Our great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book, â€śLiars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy,â€ť which is fantastic. Go get it!

@realDonaldTrump	Happy Birthday to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a friend and great man! pic.twitter.com/hlXYYkTjcv
@realDonaldTrump	Itâ€™s very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick, Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer, want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. The United States cannot stand for this. We wants safety and security at our borders!
@realDonaldTrump	Heading to Nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters. Countryâ€™s economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week. Tremendous potential, and trade deals are coming along well.
@realDonaldTrump	My thoughts and prayers are with Representative Katie Arrington of South Carolina, including all of those involved in last nights car accident, and their families. https://twitter.com/karringtonsc/status/1010500676269404166Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Drudge Report  â€śOBAMA KEPT THEM IN CAGES, WRAPPED THEM IN FOILâ€ť We do a much better job while at the same time maintaining a MUCH stronger Border! Mainstream Fake Media hates this story.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śDisability applications plunge as economy strengthensâ€ť  Failing New York Times
@realDonaldTrump	The National Association of Manufacturers just announced that 95.1% of Manufacturers â€śhave a positive outlook for their companies.â€ť  This is the best number in the Associationâ€™s history!
@realDonaldTrump	The Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged!
@realDonaldTrump	.@FoxNews  Poll numbers plummet on the Democrat inspired and paid for Russian Witch Hunt. With all of the bias, lying and hate by the investigators, people want the investigators investigated. Much more will come out. A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election!
@realDonaldTrump	Steel is coming back fast! U.S. Steel is adding great capacity also. So are others. https://twitter.com/foxbusiness/status/1010330347081351168Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. & its great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those Barriers & Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the U.S.A. Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street!
@realDonaldTrump	....Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!
@realDonaldTrump	We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country. When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came. Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order. Most children come without parents...
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats, fix the laws. Donâ€™t RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders, No Crime!
@realDonaldTrump	Major Wall Street Journal opinion piece today talking about the Russian Witch Hunt and the disgrace that it is. So many people hurt, so bad for our country - a total sham! https://www.wsj.com/articles/muellers-fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree-1529707087Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Just landed in South Carolina - will be at the McMaster rally shortly! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!
@realDonaldTrump	Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows? Isnâ€™t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?
@realDonaldTrump	â€śDirector David Lynch: Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidentsâ€ť http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2018/06/24/david-lynch-trump-could-go-down-as-one-of-the-greatest-presidents-in-history/amp/Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag. I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!  #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party. She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement. Be careful what you wish for Max!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be heading to one of my favorite places, South Carolina, to fight for one of my original â€śfighters,â€ť Governor Henry McMaster. Speaking at 7:00 P.M.
@realDonaldTrump	....If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in itâ€™s tracks - and at very little, by comparison, cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!
@realDonaldTrump	Hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country......
@realDonaldTrump	Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours. Actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama. Fake News is working overtime!
@realDonaldTrump	I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on. But you do have to ask why the DOJ & FBI arenâ€™t giving over requested documents?
@realDonaldTrump	The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders. I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside!
@realDonaldTrump	Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually, far greater than would ever have been believed!
@realDonaldTrump	.@RepClayHiggins has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes, creating great new healthcare programs at low cost, fighting for Border Security, our Military and are Vets. He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement. The Great State of Louisiana, we want Clay!
@realDonaldTrump	House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember, it still has to pass in the Senate, and for that we need 10 Democrat votes, and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and donâ€™t care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!
@realDonaldTrump	.@jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous â€śhair showâ€ť with me (where he seriously messed up my hair), & that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have â€śhumanizedâ€ť me-he is taking heat. He called & said â€śmonster ratings.â€ť Be a man Jimmy!
@realDonaldTrump	Today, we tell the story of an incredible HERO who defended our nation in World War Two â€“ First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner. Although he died 20 years ago, today he takes his rightful place in the Eternal Chronicle of American Valor... https://www.pscp.tv/w/bgKUxjFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MVlxS0RRTVJNRXpHVtw44nvKbJAlMv0UQqnot162bf70hhQOm2BCc1lQVpMl?t=8m24sÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN. Wow!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe most profound question of our era: Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the U.S., and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy?â€ť  Judge Andrew Napolitano
@realDonaldTrump	The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.
@realDonaldTrump	A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!
@realDonaldTrump	It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina. Henry is tough on Crime and Borders, loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy. GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN!
@realDonaldTrump	....We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E.U. in that they have long taken advantage of the U.S. in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs. In the end it will all even out - and it wonâ€™t take very long!
@realDonaldTrump	....When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House, I chided them about tariffs in other countries, like India, being too high. Companies are now coming back to America. Harley must know that they wonâ€™t be able to sell back into U.S. without paying a big tax!
@realDonaldTrump	....We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies. We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint. They must play fair or they will pay tariffs!
@realDonaldTrump	Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse. Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it.....
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you South Carolina. Now letâ€™s get out tomorrow and VOTE for @HenryMcMaster! https://www.pscp.tv/w/bgGOtTFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MXlvSk1WZHJWQm54Uf-J8fPu1RO4E84ax-LuK1bAbiCpnzBBZmdPfI9FAhGV?t=11sÂ â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success. Iâ€™ve done so much for you, and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We wonâ€™t forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!
@realDonaldTrump	Supreme Court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them. Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats!
@realDonaldTrump	HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WONâ€™T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS & SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME.  WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party. Together, they will Make America Weak Again! But have no fear, America is now stronger than ever before, and Iâ€™m not going anywhere!

That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President!

@realDonaldTrump	Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up. But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who. Mueller/Comey best friends!

So many questions, so much corruption!
@realDonaldTrump	Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterdayâ€™s closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions. There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged!

@realDonaldTrump	When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering. Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world. Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime. Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on Sunday on @FoxNews at 10:00 A. M. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or Filibuster, rule - or better yet, do both. Cryinâ€™ Chuck would do it on day one, but weâ€™ll never give him the chance. Some great legislation awaits - be smart!
@realDonaldTrump	I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill, either GOODLATTE 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold. I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov.
@realDonaldTrump	A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, Sean Spicer, has written a great new book, â€śThe Briefing: Politics, the Press and the President.â€ť It is a story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good, go get it!

@realDonaldTrump	To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance, It will never happen!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen. I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 & clean out the toughest of situations. They are great!
@realDonaldTrump	A big week, especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. Heading back to the White House now. Focus will be on the selection of a new Supreme Court Justice. Exciting times for our country. Economy may be stronger than it has ever been!
@realDonaldTrump	The Liberal Left, also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job, and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again
@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10:00 A.M. on @FoxNews

@realDonaldTrump	Thank you, @WVGovernor Jim Justice, for that warm introduction. Tonight, it was my great honor to attend the â€śGreenbrier Classic â€“ Salute to Service Dinnerâ€ť in West Virginia! God Bless our Veterans. God Bless America - and HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY TO ALL! https://www.pscp.tv/w/bgv63DFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MVJEeGxXRFlqam1KTO0_mi6QQi7XVM8hwHDlXI3Cpzn-RCN4Z3j6OIp50Q1J?t=1sÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake. I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized!
@realDonaldTrump	The Washington Post is constantly quoting â€śanonymous sourcesâ€ť that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others!
@realDonaldTrump	Heading to West Virginia to be with my friend, @WVGovernor Jim Justice, at his beautiful Greenbrier Resort. He works hard, does a great job, and raises lots of money for charities!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! The NSA has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages. Privacy violations? They blame technical irregularities. Such a disgrace. The Witch Hunt continues!
@realDonaldTrump	Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S. Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017. The U.S. is where the Action is!
@realDonaldTrump	Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?
@realDonaldTrump	Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well! In the meantime, no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months. All of Asia is thrilled. Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining. If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea!
@realDonaldTrump	How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November. The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement!
@realDonaldTrump	When we have an â€śinfestationâ€ť of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out? ICE! They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country. Dems do not appreciate the great job they do! Nov.
@realDonaldTrump	The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before, and thatâ€™s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country. In any event, they are coming along very well. Most countries agree that they must be changed, but nobody ever asked!
@realDonaldTrump	I interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday. On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court!
@realDonaldTrump	Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party. Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats!
@realDonaldTrump	Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their â€śleadershipâ€ť wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE, thereby declaring war on Law & Order. These people will be voting for Republicans in November and, in many cases, joining the Republican Party!
@realDonaldTrump	The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up & they are doing little to help. If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $â€™s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	Happy Fourth of July....Our Country is doing GREAT!
@realDonaldTrump	Tomorrow, families across our Nation will gather to celebrate the Fourth of July. As we do, we will think of the men & women serving overseas at this very moment, far away from their families, protecting America - & we will thank GOD for blessing us with these incredible HEROES! pic.twitter.com/FQ1D7oEta2

Hiring thousands of â€śjudgesâ€ť does not work and is not acceptable - only Country in the World that does this!
@realDonaldTrump	Congress must pass smart, fast and reasonable Immigration Laws now. Law Enforcement at the Border is doing a great job, but the laws they are forced to work with are insane. When people, with or without children, enter our Country, they must be told to leave without our........

@realDonaldTrump	Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!
@realDonaldTrump	A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities, to let drugs pour into our cities, and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans. Democrats want anarchy, amnesty and chaos - Republicans want LAW, ORDER and JUSTICE!
@realDonaldTrump	It was my great honor to join proud, hardworking American Patriots in Montana tonight. I love you - thank you! #MAGA https://www.pscp.tv/w/bg6j5zFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MWpNSmdFV0JPUllLTJfoBJQmP6mk0kRGh5Wxiz6SvxIkWD8obbmiX_ruzIlF?t=1sÂ â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) & now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillaryâ€™s illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta & so much more. Itâ€™s a Democrat Con Job!
@realDonaldTrump	Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the â€śSpecialâ€ť Counsel because the public understands that there was no  Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!
@realDonaldTrump	Big decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court!
@realDonaldTrump	Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon, the Washington Post, who constantly quote anonymous sources that, in my opinion, donâ€™t exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years!

@realDonaldTrump	Pfizer & others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. They are merely taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves, while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere. We will respond!
@realDonaldTrump	The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out. The U.S. strongly supports breast feeding but we donâ€™t believe women should be denied access to formula. Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty.
@realDonaldTrump	I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed &, even more importantly, our handshake. We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea. China, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not!
@realDonaldTrump	I have long heard that the most important decision a U.S. President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9:00 P.M.
@realDonaldTrump	...Europe far more than it does the U.S. By some accounts, the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S., with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more. Germany is at 1%, the U.S. is at 4%, and NATO benefits.......
@realDonaldTrump	Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so American patients donâ€™t pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people!
@realDonaldTrump	The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO, and nicely pay for it. Just doesnâ€™t work!
@realDonaldTrump	A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans, especially Hispanics, feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama.
@realDonaldTrump	Many countries in NATO, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made. Will they reimburse the U.S.?

@realDonaldTrump	I am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about  the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years. Total disgrace!
@realDonaldTrump	On behalf of the United States, congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand. Such a beautiful moment - all freed, great job!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to all of my great supporters, really big progress being made. Other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals. Economy is ROARING. Supreme Court pick getting GREAT REVIEWS. New Poll says Trump, at over 90%, is the most popular Republican in history of the Party. Wow!
@realDonaldTrump	NATO countries must pay MORE, the United States must pay LESS. Very Unfair!
@realDonaldTrump	Getting ready to leave for Europe. First meeting - NATO. The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs (& Barriers)!
@realDonaldTrump	Tonight, it was my honor and privilege to nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court. #SCOTUS pic.twitter.com/97clc9zifm
@realDonaldTrump	Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isnâ€™t nearly enough. U.S. spends too much. Europeâ€™s borders are BAD! Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!
@realDonaldTrump	How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok? Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear!
@realDonaldTrump	Ex-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow, but is anybody really surprised!  Together with her lover, FBI Agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!
@realDonaldTrump	If the Democrats want to win Supreme Court and other Court picks, donâ€™t Obstruct and Resist, but rather do it the good olâ€™ fashioned way, WIN ELECTIONS!
@realDonaldTrump	What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europeâ€™s protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct - vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now. I am watching what is going on from Europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. They are just using children!
@realDonaldTrump	...things up, better than ever before, but it canâ€™t go too quickly. I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win!
@realDonaldTrump	I am in Brussels, but always thinking about our farmers. Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. Farmers have done poorly for 15 years. Other countriesâ€™ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open...

@realDonaldTrump	....On top of it all, Germany just started paying Russia, the country they want protection from, Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia. Not acceptable! All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4%!
@realDonaldTrump	Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!
@realDonaldTrump	As I head out to a very important NATO meeting, I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena & is refusing to show up and testify. What can she possibly say about her statements and lies. So much corruption on the other side. Where is the Attorney General? @FoxNews

@realDonaldTrump	These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years. Why didnâ€™t Obama do something about it?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, thatâ€™s why.

I got 306! They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage. Still hurting!
@realDonaldTrump	So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didnâ€™t! But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin. Fake News......
@realDonaldTrump	The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration. Why didnâ€™t they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election?
@realDonaldTrump	....Where is the DNC Server, and why didnâ€™t the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?
@realDonaldTrump	The Stock Market hit 25,000 yesterday. Jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. It is all happening!

@realDonaldTrump	Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldnâ€™t happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!
@realDonaldTrump	Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present & future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong & rich!
@realDonaldTrump	The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @RandPaul. â€śThe President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - whatâ€™s he supposed to think?â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia. Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future, only because of me. NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!
@realDonaldTrump	The two biggest opponents of ICE in America today are the Democratic Party and MS-13!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Congressman Kevin Yoder! He secured $5 BILLION for Border Security. Now we need Congress to support. Kevin has been strong on Crime, the Border, the 2nd Amendment, and he loves our Military and Vets. @RepKevinYoder has my full and total endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement.
@realDonaldTrump	3.4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory - far greater than ever anticipated, and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition!
@realDonaldTrump	Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. Itâ€™s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śA lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again.â€ť  @foxandfriends @kilmeade

@realDonaldTrump	....Russia has agreed to help with North Korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. There is no rush, the sanctions remain! Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process!
@realDonaldTrump	While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with Russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success. Many positive things will come out of that meeting..
@realDonaldTrump	So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki. Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting. We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match. Big results will come!

@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that Iâ€™ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup, sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction. Problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity. But Iâ€™ll complain anyway!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ICE. This should cost them heavily in the Midterms. Yesterday, the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs. Likewise to Pfizer. We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs.
@realDonaldTrump	A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected U.S. Pastor, Andrew Brunson, from prison. He has been held hostage far too long. @RT_Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband & father. He has done nothing wrong, and his family needs him!
@realDonaldTrump	The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - canâ€™t believe it! Isnâ€™t it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart? The $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand. First time kneeling, out for game. Second time kneeling, out for season/no pay!
@realDonaldTrump	I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud & vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!

@realDonaldTrump	Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	....The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well. Tightening now hurts all that we have done. The U.S. should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals. Debt coming due & we are raising rates - Really?
@realDonaldTrump	China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. As usual, not a level playing field...

@realDonaldTrump	Brian Kemp, who is running for Governor of Georgia and has my full endorsement, is campaigning tonight with VP @mike_pence. Brian is very strong on Crime and Borders, LOVES our Military, Vets and the 2nd Amendment. He will be a GREAT Governor!
@realDonaldTrump	No Collusion, No Obstruction - but that doesnâ€™t matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election. Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing!
@realDonaldTrump	The Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W.H.), seems intent on damaging the Republican Partyâ€™s chances in the November Election. This Democrat excuse for losing the â€16 Election never ends!
@realDonaldTrump	Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyerâ€™s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!
@realDonaldTrump	So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didnâ€™t he do something about it? Why didnâ€™t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax, thatâ€™s why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!
@realDonaldTrump	Happy Birthday @SenatorDole! https://twitter.com/SenatorDole/status/1021104267564847104Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!
@realDonaldTrump	.@PeteHegseth on @FoxNews  â€śSource #1 was the (Fake) Dossier. Yes, the Dirty Dossier, paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump, and looking for information that could discredit Candidate #1 Trump. Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign...â€ť ILLEGAL!
@realDonaldTrump	Andrew McCarthy - â€śI said this could never happen. This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it. It is so bad it screams out at you.â€ť  On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents. As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of â€śJusticeâ€ť and FBI misled the courts. Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam!
@realDonaldTrump	....In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon. Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought?
@realDonaldTrump	The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the U.S. Supreme Court two months ago. Next up is the U.S. Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their â€śdelivery boyâ€ť for a BIG percentage of their packages....
@realDonaldTrump	A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months. Likewise, no Nuclear Tests. Japan is happy, all of Asia is happy. But the Fake News is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that I am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong, very happy!
@realDonaldTrump	When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all that I gave up, remember, I gave up NOTHING, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the Corrupt Media!
@realDonaldTrump	.....â€ťCarter Page wasnâ€™t a spy, wasnâ€™t an agent of the Russians - he would have cooperated with the FBI. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump.â€ť Tom Fitton @JudicialWatch A disgrace to America. They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now!
@realDonaldTrump	....and the DOJ, FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account. Source #1 was the major source. Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it. Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team. Not about Carter Page..was all about getting Trump.....
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIt was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team. This is a Clinton Campaign document. It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump....
@realDonaldTrump	So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Tom Fitton on @foxandfriends at 6:15 A.M. NOW! Judicial Watch.
@realDonaldTrump	To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!

@realDonaldTrump	Iâ€™m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely donâ€™t want Trump!

@realDonaldTrump	Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs. Itâ€™s as simple as that - and everybodyâ€™s talking! Remember, we are the â€śpiggy bankâ€ť thatâ€™s being robbed. All will be Great!
@realDonaldTrump	"Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago but, as the saying goes, better late than never!"

@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night. Wow, 69-30, those are big numbers. Now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you. She is weak on Vets, the Military and the 2nd Amendment. Win!
@realDonaldTrump	What kind of a lawyer would tape a client? So sad! Is this a first, never heard of it before? Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things? I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so? Too bad!
@realDonaldTrump	China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now! China made $517 Billion on us last year.
@realDonaldTrump	When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity. Negotiations are going really well, be cool. The end result will be worth it!
@realDonaldTrump	Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trumpâ€ť is a Hot Seller, already Number One! More importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about. It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly. Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett!
@realDonaldTrump	So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldnâ€™t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People. Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not Sinclair. Disgraceful!
@realDonaldTrump	The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it, we are ready - but they wonâ€™t!

A total disgrace. Mitch M should not let them go home until all approved!
@realDonaldTrump	....Also, why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems, some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary, others, including himself, have worked for Obama....And why isnâ€™t Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta, Dossier?
@realDonaldTrump	Is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship, I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S.C.) & Comey is his close friend..
@realDonaldTrump	There is No Collusion! The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam!

@realDonaldTrump	The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by $52 Billion and, of course, the historically low unemployment numbers, especially for African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Women.
@realDonaldTrump	Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A.G. Sulzberger, Publisher of the New York Times. Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, â€śEnemy of the People.â€ť Sad!
@realDonaldTrump	Please understand, there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally, whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes.

@realDonaldTrump	â€śWe already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent, it was Hillary Clinton. How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad?â€ť Marc Thiessen, Washington Post
@realDonaldTrump	Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and â€śPublic Enemy Number One,â€ť or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? Where is the Russian Collusion?
@realDonaldTrump	Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was, along with Comey, McCabe, Strzok and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!
@realDonaldTrump	Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders. He worked for me for a very short time. Why didnâ€™t government tell me that he was under investigation. These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax!
@realDonaldTrump	..This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further. Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA!
@realDonaldTrump	.....remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated. This is a real issue. It wonâ€™t go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys. Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation.â€ť ALAN DERSHOWITZ....

@realDonaldTrump	....China, which is for the first time doing poorly against us, is spending a fortune on ads and P.R. trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on Tariffs- because they are really hurting their economy. Likewise other countries. We are Winning, but must be strong!
@realDonaldTrump	....Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. Only fools would disagree. We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and, if countries are still unwilling to negotiate, they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs. We win either way......
@realDonaldTrump	....Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry. Plants are opening all over the U.S., Steelworkers are working again, and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury. Other countries use Tariffs against, but when we use them, foolish people scream!
@realDonaldTrump	Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated. China market has dropped 27% in last 4months, and they are talking to us. Our market is stronger than ever, and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated. America First.......

@realDonaldTrump	...Why arenâ€™t Mueller and the 17 Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ? This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country. Fortunately, the facts are all coming out, and fast!
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower. This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere. I did not know about it!
@realDonaldTrump	..Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the Obama Administration, while at the same time reducing taxes for our people. At minimum, we will make much better Trade Deals for our country!
@realDonaldTrump	Tariffs are working big time. Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the U.S., always to our detriment. I say, as they come,Tax them. If they donâ€™t want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the U.S. In either event, it means jobs and great wealth.....
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know itâ€™s TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People. They purposely cause great division & distrust. They can also cause War! They are very dangerous & sick!

@realDonaldTrump	So nice, thank you both! https://twitter.com/DiamondandSilk/status/1028816390663426048Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The Dems have tried every trick in the playbook-call me everything under the sun. But if Iâ€™m all of those terrible things, how come I beat them so badly, 306-223? Maybe theyâ€™re just not very good! The fact is they are going CRAZY only because they know they canâ€™t beat me in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans are doing really well with the Senate Midterms. Races that we were not even thinking about winning are now very close, or even leading. Election night will be very interesting indeed!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Social Media (and beyond) Stars, @DiamondandSilk, are terrific people who are doing really well. We are all very proud of them, and their great success!
@realDonaldTrump	Just had calls with South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, and Virginia Governor Ralph Northam regarding the incoming storm. Federal Government stands by, ready to assist 24/7.
@realDonaldTrump	My people just informed me that this is one of the worst storms to hit the East Coast in many years. Also, looking like a direct hit on North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Please be prepared, be careful and be SAFE!
@realDonaldTrump	Was just briefed via phone by @DHSgov @SecNielsen and @FEMA @FEMA_Brock, along with @VP Mike Pence and Chief of Staff, John Kelly on incoming storm which is very dangerous. Heed the directions of your State and Local Officials - and know that WE are here for you. Be SAFE! pic.twitter.com/sN8D5NvrBa
@realDonaldTrump	Chuck Schumer is holding up 320 appointments (Ambassadors, Executives, etc.) of great people who have left jobs and given up so much in order to come into Government. Schumer and the Democrats continue to OBSTRUCT!
@realDonaldTrump	To the incredible citizens of North Carolina, South Carolina and the entire East Coast - the storm looks very bad! Please take all necessary precautions. We have already began mobilizing our assets to respond accordingly, and we are here for you! pic.twitter.com/g74cyD6b6K
@realDonaldTrump	The Storms in the Atlantic are very dangerous. We encourage anyone in the path of these storms to prepare themselves and to heed the warnings of State and Local officials. The Federal Government is closely monitoring and ready to assist. We are with you!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śPresident Trump would need a magic wand to get to 4% GDP,â€ť stated President Obama. I guess I have a magic wand, 4.2%, and we will do MUCH better than this! We have just begun.
@realDonaldTrump	The Economy is soooo good, perhaps the best in our countryâ€™s history (remember, itâ€™s the economy stupid!), that the Democrats are flailing & lying like CRAZY! Phony books, articles and T.V. â€śhitsâ€ť like no other pol has had to endure-and they are losing big. Very dishonest people!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIt is mostly anonymous sources in here, why should anyone trust you? General Mattis, General Kelly said itâ€™s not true.â€ť @SavannahGuthrie @TODAYshow  Bob Woodward is a liar who is like a Dem operative prior to the Midterms. He was caught cold, even by NBC.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIâ€™m taking this book with a grain of salt & everyone should do the same. Multiple sources, but almost every one of them has come out and discredited the claims made by Woodward. You cannot take this book too seriously.â€ť Katelyn Caralle, Washington Examiner
@realDonaldTrump	The White House is a â€śsmooth running machine.â€ť We are making some of the biggest and most important deals in our countryâ€™s history - with many more to come! The Dems are going crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	The Woodward book is a Joke - just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults, using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources. Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them, like the book, are fiction. Dems canâ€™t stand losing. Iâ€™ll write the real book!
@realDonaldTrump	If the Democrats had won the Election in 2016, GDP, which was about 1% and going down, would have been minus 4% instead of up 4.2%. I opened up our beautiful economic engine with Regulation and Tax Cuts. Our system was choking and would have been made worse. Still plenty to do!
@realDonaldTrump	The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!

@realDonaldTrump	We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan). We are ready for the big one that is coming!

In other words, itâ€™s time to end this Witch Hunt.â€ť @LouDobbs   Russian â€ścollusionâ€ť was just an excuse by the Democrats for having lost the Election!

@realDonaldTrump	The Wall Street Journal has it wrong, we are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us. Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home. If we meet, we meet?
@realDonaldTrump	.....This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico. If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list. Bad politics. I love Puerto Rico!
@realDonaldTrump	3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico. When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths. As time went by it did not go up by much. Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000...

@realDonaldTrump	We are completely ready for hurricane Florence, as the storm gets even larger and more powerful. Be careful!
@realDonaldTrump	The problem with banker Jamie Dimon running for President is that he doesnâ€™t have the aptitude or â€śsmartsâ€ť & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess - otherwise he is wonderful. Iâ€™ve made a lot of bankers, and others, look much smarter than they are with my great economic policy!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThey say all these people died in the storm in Puerto Rico, yet 70% of the power was out before the storm. So when did people start dying? At what point do you recognize that what they are doing is a political agenda couched in the nice language of journalism?â€ť  @GeraldoRivera

@realDonaldTrump	When will Republican leadership learn that they are being played like a fiddle by the Democrats on Border Security and Building the Wall? Without Borders, we donâ€™t have a country. With Open Borders, which the Democrats want, we have nothing but crime! Finish the Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	While my (our) poll numbers are good, with the Economy being the best ever, if it werenâ€™t for the Rigged Russian Witch Hunt, they would be 25 points higher!

@realDonaldTrump	Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He is just looking for attention and doesnâ€™t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!

@realDonaldTrump	Senator Richard Blumenthal must talk about his fraudulent service in Vietnam, where for 12 years he told the people of Connecticut, as their Attorney General, that he was a great Marine War Hero. Talked about his many battles of near death, but was never in Vietnam. Total Phony!
@realDonaldTrump	Just started, tonight, our 7th FBI investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He will someday be recognized as a truly great Justice of The United States Supreme Court!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! Just starting to hear the Democrats, who are only thinking Obstruct and Delay, are starting to put out the word that the â€śtimeâ€ť and â€śscopeâ€ť of FBI looking into Judge Kavanaugh and witnesses is not enough. Hello! For them, it will never be enough - stay tuned and watch!
@realDonaldTrump	So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things I have done, how do Democrats, who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK, win the Black Vote?  And it will only get better!
@realDonaldTrump	Like many, I donâ€™t watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm. It is just a political ad for the Dems. Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told â€śnoâ€ť), was great. Heâ€™s leading the charge!
@realDonaldTrump	NBC News incorrectly reported (as usual) that I was limiting the FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh, and witnesses, only to certain people. Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion. Please correct your reporting!

@realDonaldTrump	Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie, Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public. Harvard called her â€śa person of colorâ€ť (amazing con), and would not have taken her otherwise!
@realDonaldTrump	Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed. She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her, â€śDNA test is useless.â€ť Even they donâ€™t want her. Phony!

@realDonaldTrump	Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time, big mistake!
@realDonaldTrump	Great job being done by Congressman Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania. Thank you Keith!
@realDonaldTrump	In Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!
@realDonaldTrump	Had a very good conversation with the newly elected President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin. We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on Trade, Military and everything else! Excellent call, wished him congrats!
@realDonaldTrump	....of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony. Fake News Must End!
@realDonaldTrump	There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news. The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly. That will do much to put out the flame...
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans, Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country. Actually, it is their Fake & Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand!
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman @KevinYoder has fought hard for the People of Kansas. Highly respected, strong on Crime, the Border, Military, Vets and Second Amendment. Kevin has my Total Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	....Richard Cordray will let you down, just like he did when he destroyed the government agency that he ran. Clone of Pocahontas, thatâ€™s not for Ohio. Mike has my Total Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	.@MikeDeWine will be a great Governor for the People of Ohio. He is an outstanding man who loves his State â€“ and always produces big....
@realDonaldTrump	Just out: Consumer Confidence hits highest level since 2000.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIf the Fed backs off and starts talking a little more Dovish, I think weâ€™re going to be right back to our 2,800 to 2,900 target range that weâ€™ve had for the S&P 500.â€ť Scott Wren, Wells Fargo.
@realDonaldTrump	The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders!
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas is so popular in his District, and far beyond, that he doesnâ€™t need any help - but I am giving it to him anyway. He is a great guy and the absolute â€śKingâ€ť of Cutting Taxes. Highly respected by all, he loves his State & Country. Strong Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman Andy Barr of Kentucky, who just had a great debate with his Nancy Pelosi run opponent, has been a winner for his State. Strong on Crime, the Border, Tax Cuts, Military, Vets and 2nd Amendment, we need Andy in D.C. He has my Strong Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	".@Erik_Paulsen, @Jason2CD, @JimHagedornMN and @PeteStauber love our Country and the Great State of Minnesota. They are winners and always get the job done. We need them all in Congress for #MAGA. Border, Military, Vets, 2nd A. Go Vote Minnesota. They have my Strong Endorsement!"
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman @DaveBratVA7th is a fighter who is doing a great job for Virginia and for our Country. Border, Military, Vets, 2nd Amendment and all else. We need Dave in D.C. He has my Strong Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	Congresswoman @cathymcmorris of Washington State is an incredible leader who is respected by everyone in Congress. We need her badly in D.C. to keep building on #MAGA. She has my Strong Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman @RodBlum of Iowa got a desperately needed Flood Wall for Cedar Rapids that was almost impossible to get. He makes a BIG difference for Iowa! Border, Military, Vets etc. We need Rod in D.C. He has my Strong Endorsement!
@realDonaldTrump	.@Denver4VA of the 5th District in Virginia is a popular guy who really knows how to get the job done! Really big help with Tax Cuts, the Military and our great Vets. He has my Total Endorsement!

@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed by Laura Ingraham  tonight at 10:00 P.M. on @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	Check out tweets from last two days. I refer to Fake News Media when mentioning Enemy of the People - but dishonest reporters use only the word â€śMedia.â€ť The people of our Great Country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much Fake News. They get it, and fully understand!
@realDonaldTrump	CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the â€śMedia is the Enemy of the People.â€ť Wrong! I said that the â€śFake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People,â€ť a very big difference. When you give out false information - not good!
@realDonaldTrump	It is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country. Vote Republican now!  http://Vote.GOPÂ  pic.twitter.com/2crea9HF7G

@realDonaldTrump	Yesterday in Pittsburgh I was really impressed with Congressman Keith Rothfus (far more so than any other local political figure). His sincere level of compassion, grief and sorrow for the events that took place was, in its own way, very inspiring. Vote for Keith!
@realDonaldTrump	Harry Reid, when he was sane, agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship! pic.twitter.com/ypiE1QWKag
@realDonaldTrump	Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about! Our new Republican Majority will work on this, Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans will protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the Dems!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śDonald Trump has made good on his promises, and it drives Democrats Crazy!â€ť Brad Blakeman @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	The World is using our laws to our detriment. They laugh at the Stupidity they see!
@realDonaldTrump	....Harry Reid was right in 1993, before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive Crime) â€śstuff.â€ť Donâ€™t forget the nasty term Anchor Babies. I will keep our Country safe. This case will be settled by the United States Supreme Court!
@realDonaldTrump	So-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other. It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words â€śsubject to the jurisdiction thereof.â€ť Many legal scholars agree.....
@realDonaldTrump	Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day. We were treated so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful! pic.twitter.com/9B9HgCF1G9
@realDonaldTrump	Stock Market up more than 400 points yesterday. Today looks to be another good one. Companies earnings are great!
@realDonaldTrump	Our military is being mobilized at the Southern Border. Many more troops coming. We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the U.S. Our Border is sacred, must come in legally. TURN AROUND!
@realDonaldTrump	The Caravans are made up of some very tough fighters and people. Fought back hard and viciously against Mexico at Northern Border before breaking through. Mexican soldiers hurt, were unable, or unwilling to stop Caravan. Should stop them before they reach our Border, but wonâ€™t!

@realDonaldTrump	Rumor has it that Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana is paying for Facebook ads for his so-called opponent on the libertarian ticket. Donnelly is trying to steal the election? Isnâ€™t that what Russia did!?
@realDonaldTrump	Arizona is such a Great State but it needs Border Security which @MarthaMcSally will provide, and Krysten Sinema doesnâ€™t even think about. If it were up to Sinema - drugs, crime and illegal traffic will be flowing into Arizona at an ever increasing pace. Vote for Martha!
@realDonaldTrump	If Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi gain the majority, they will try to raise your taxes, restore job-killing regulations, shut down your coal mines and timber mills, take away your healthcare, impose socialism, and ERASE your borders.

@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to @PeteHegseth and @KatiePavlich for your nice, and very wise, statements on the Economy. You both really get it! @foxandfriends

@realDonaldTrump	REMEMBER FLORIDA: I have been President of the United States for almost two years. During that time Senator Bill Nelson didnâ€™t call me once. Rick Scott called constantly requesting dollars plus for Florida. Did a GREAT job on hurricanes. VOTE SCOTT!
@realDonaldTrump	So funny to see the CNN Fake Suppression Polls and false rhetoric. Watch for real results Tuesday. We are lucky CNNâ€™s ratings are so low. Donâ€™t fall for the Suppression Game. Go out & VOTE. Remember, we now have perhaps the greatest Economy (JOBS) in the history of our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	I need @claudiatenney of #NY22 to be re-elected in order to get our big plans moving. Her opponent would be a disaster. Nobody works harder than Claudia, and she is a producer. I look forward to working together with her - she has my Strongest Endorsement! Vote Claudia!

@realDonaldTrump	If @AndrewGillum did the same job with Florida that he has done in Tallahassee as Mayor, the State will be a crime ridden, overtaxed mess. @RonDeSantisFL will be a great Governor. VOTE!!!!!!
@realDonaldTrump	.@DebbieStabenow voted against Tax Cuts, great Healthcare, Supreme Court Justices and all of the many things the people of Michigan wanted and need. She is an automatic far left vote, controlled by her bosses. John James can be a truly great Senator!
@realDonaldTrump	Dana Rohrabacher has been a great Congressman for his District and for the people of Cal. He works hard and is respected by all - he produces! Dems are desperate to replace Dana by spending vast sums to elect a super liberal who is weak on Crime and bad for our Military & Vets!
@realDonaldTrump	John James, running as a Republican for the Senate from Michigan, is a spectacular young star of the future. We should make him a star of the present. A distinguished West Point Grad and Vet, people should Vote Out Schumer Puppet Debbie Stabenow, who does nothing for Michigan!

@realDonaldTrump	According to NBC News, Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%). You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt, led by 17 Angry Democrats, is all about!
@realDonaldTrump	In all fairness, Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!
@realDonaldTrump	If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level. Two can play that game!
@realDonaldTrump	To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be doing a news conference at The White House - 11:30 A.M. Will be discussing our success in the Midterms!
@realDonaldTrump	Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well. Those that did not, say goodbye! Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media!
@realDonaldTrump	Ron DeSantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the Governor of Florida. Congratulations to Ron and family!
@realDonaldTrump	Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!
@realDonaldTrump	.@DavidAsmanfox  â€śHow do the Democrats respond to this? Think of how his position with Republicans improves-all the candidates who won tonight. They realize how important he is because of what he did in campaigning for them. They owe him their political career.â€ť Thanks, I agree!
@realDonaldTrump	....unbelievably lucky to have him and Iâ€™m just awed at how well theyâ€™ve done. Itâ€™s all the Trump magic - Trump is the magic man. Incredible, heâ€™s got the entire media against him, attacking him every day, and he pulls out these enormous wins.â€ť Ben Stein, â€śThe Capitalist Codeâ€ť
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThereâ€™s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election. Mr. Trump has magic about him. This guy has magic coming out of his ears. He is an astonishing vote getter & campaigner. The Republicans are.........
@realDonaldTrump	Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!
@realDonaldTrump	....Great bravery shown by police. California Highway Patrol was on scene within 3 minutes, with first officer to enter shot numerous times. That Sheriffâ€™s Sergeant died in the hospital. God bless all of the victims and families of the victims. Thank you to Law Enforcement.
@realDonaldTrump	I have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California. Law Enforcement and First Responders, together with the FBI, are on scene. 13 people, at this time, have been reported dead. Likewise, the shooter is dead, along with the first police officer to enter the bar....
@realDonaldTrump	President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S., China and Russia. Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!
@realDonaldTrump	Just out â€” in Arizona, SIGNATURES DONâ€™T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. The WORLD is now watching closely!
@realDonaldTrump	In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County, which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a â€śnumber,â€ť couldnâ€™t do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory!
@realDonaldTrump	Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him â€śback into play.â€ť Bill Nelson conceded Election - now heâ€™s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!
@realDonaldTrump	Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they â€śfoundâ€ť many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes. â€śThe Broward Effect.â€ť How come they never find Republican votes?
@realDonaldTrump	Jeff Flake(y) doesnâ€™t want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel, he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the â€ścrimeâ€ť of doing a terrible job! A weak and ineffective guy!
@realDonaldTrump	As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes. Donâ€™t worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD!
@realDonaldTrump	You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia â€“ but the Election was on Tuesday? Letâ€™s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!

@realDonaldTrump	These California fires are expanding very, very quickly (in some cases 80-100 acres a minute). If people donâ€™t evacuate quickly, they risk being overtaken by the fire. Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials!
@realDonaldTrump	More than 4,000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170,000 acres. Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died. The destruction is catastrophic. God Bless them all.
@realDonaldTrump	Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!

@realDonaldTrump	I am in Paris getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One. Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time?
@realDonaldTrump	There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now, or no more Fed payments!
@realDonaldTrump	....Mr. Whitaker is very highly thought of by @SenJoniErnst, Senator @ChuckGrassley, Ambassador @TerryBranstad, Leonard Leo of Federalist Society, and many more. I feel certain he will make an outstanding Acting Attorney General!
@realDonaldTrump	Matthew G. Whitaker is a highly respected former U.S. Attorney from Iowa. He was chosen by Jeff Sessions to be his Chief of Staff. I did not know Mr. Whitaker. Likewise, as Chief, I did not know Mr. Whitaker except primarily as he traveled with A.G. Sessions. No social contact...

@realDonaldTrump	The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!
@realDonaldTrump	The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!
@realDonaldTrump	.....of money spent on protecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses. It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves...and Trade must be made FREE and FAIR!
@realDonaldTrump	.....hundreds of billions of dollars, for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade. I told them that this situation cannot continue - It is, and always has been, ridiculously unfair to the United States. Massive amounts.....
@realDonaldTrump	Just returned from France where much was accomplished in my meetings with World Leaders. Never easy bringing up the fact that the U.S. must be treated fairly, which it hasnâ€™t, on both Military and Trade. We pay for LARGE portions of other countries military protection,........

@realDonaldTrump	By the way, when the helicopter couldnâ€™t fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility, I suggested driving. Secret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown. Speech next day at American Cemetery in pouring rain! Little reported-Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	......MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!........
@realDonaldTrump	On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!
@realDonaldTrump	Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia. But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France? They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along. Pay for NATO or not!

@realDonaldTrump	Universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people. Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary, Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page & her lover, Peter S, and all of his friends on the other side?
@realDonaldTrump	....care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years. They wonâ€™t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!
@realDonaldTrump	The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and donâ€™t...

@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Ron DeSantis on becoming the new Governor of Florida. Against all odds, he fought & fought & fought, the result being a historic victory. He never gave up and never will. He will be a great Governor!
@realDonaldTrump	From day one Rick Scott never wavered. He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida. Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!
@realDonaldTrump	Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A., often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum, will be detained or turned away. Dems must approve Border Security & Wall NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that â€śthe City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months.â€ť Likewise, the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!

@realDonaldTrump	Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster. It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%, & is used to get an almost guaranteed result. Judges must not Legislate Security...

@realDonaldTrump	Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in U.S. No longer). Dems created this problem. No crossings!
@realDonaldTrump	The large and violent French protests donâ€™t take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection. Both of these topics must be remedied soon.

@realDonaldTrump	.@60Minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration. In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are, but it was in 2014 during O years. Obama separated....

@realDonaldTrump	The reason that the small truck business in the U.S. is such a go to favorite is that, for many years, Tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country. It is called the â€śchicken tax.â€ť If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here.....
@realDonaldTrump	While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way, at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief. This is our Joseph McCarthy Era!

@realDonaldTrump	Brenda Snipes, in charge of voting in Broward County, Florida, was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 I VOTED signs on it. Just kidding, she is a fine, very honorable and highly respected voting tactician!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace. They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they donâ€™t want to look at the DNC Server), but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED & acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena!
@realDonaldTrump	We have been working hard on this - and itâ€™s only going to get better! https://www.wsj.com/articles/sticking-it-to-pharmawith-competition-1542674076Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	With all of the new books coming out you can't forget two of the great originals written by @GreggJarrett and @JudgeJeanine Pirro. Their books both went to #1. Go get them now, the phony Witch Hunt is well explained!
@realDonaldTrump	.@DBonginoâ€™s new book, "Spygate: The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump," is terrific. He's tough, he's smart, and he really gets it. His book is on sale now, I highly recommend!
@realDonaldTrump	....They have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas. This book is on sale now - a terrific read of a really interesting subject!
@realDonaldTrump	.@StephenMoore and Arthur Laffer, two very talented men, have just completed an incredible book on my Economic Policies or, as they call it, #TRUMPONOMICS....
@realDonaldTrump	.@SteveScalise has written an absolutely fascinating book (BACK IN THE GAME) on the world of D.C. politics, and more. He has experienced so much, in a short period of time. Few people have had his bravery or courage, and he has come all the way back. A big power and great person!
@realDonaldTrump	....in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin. I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!
@realDonaldTrump	Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia, I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting....
@realDonaldTrump	Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A. because of the Tariffs being charged to China, and there is a long way to go. If companies donâ€™t want to pay Tariffs, build in the U.S.A. Otherwise, lets just make our Country richer than ever before!
@realDonaldTrump	When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever? After wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible?), it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia. So Ridiculous!
@realDonaldTrump	Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats arenâ€™t even looking at the atrocious, and perhaps subversive, crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. A total disgrace!
@realDonaldTrump	General Motors is very counter to what other auto, and other, companies are doing. Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. Auto companies are pouring into the U.S., including BMW, which just announced a major new plant. The U.S.A. is booming!
@realDonaldTrump	So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt. This total Hoax will be studied for years!
@realDonaldTrump	Sebastian Gorka, a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House, has just written an excellent book, â€śWhy We Fight.â€ť Much will be learned from this very good read!
@realDonaldTrump	Great reviews on the USMCA - sooo much better than NAFTA!
@realDonaldTrump	To the Great people of Alaska. You have been hit hard by a â€śbig one.â€ť Please follow the directions of the highly trained professionals who are there to help you. Your Federal Government will spare no expense. God Bless you ALL!
@realDonaldTrump	Just signed one of the most important, and largest, Trade Deals in U.S. and World History. The United States, Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document. The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone. The USMCA will be fantastic for all!
@realDonaldTrump	....Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia. Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didnâ€™t do the project. Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Oh, I get it! I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds, I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail...
@realDonaldTrump	Arrived in Argentina with a very busy two days planned. Important meetings scheduled throughout. Our great Country is extremely well represented. Will be very productive!
@realDonaldTrump	Alan Dershowitz: â€śThese are not crimes. He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner. I donâ€™t see any evidence of crimes.â€ť  This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately. Mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side. Where is the IG REPORT?
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThis demonstrates the Robert Mueller and his partisans have no evidence, not a whiff of collusion, between Trump and the Russians. Russian project legal. Trump Tower meeting (son Don), perfectly legal. He wasnâ€™t involved with hacking.â€ť     Gregg Jarrett.  A total Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Just landed in Argentina with @FLOTUS Melania! #G20Summit pic.twitter.com/Zg15gmPazF
@realDonaldTrump	As RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel oversaw history defying gains in the Senate and unprecedented fundraising strength. I have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 re-elect, because there is no one better for the job!
@realDonaldTrump	....However, out of respect for the Bush Family and former President George H.W. Bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference.
@realDonaldTrump	I was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving Argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the G20....
@realDonaldTrump	President George H.W. Bush led a long, successful and beautiful life.  Whenever I was with him I saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family. His accomplishments were great from beginning to end. He was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all!

@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to newly inaugurated Mexican President @lopezobrador_. He had a tremendous political victory with the great support of the Mexican People. We will work well together for many years to come!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to being with the Bush Family to pay my respects to President George H.W. Bush.
@realDonaldTrump	Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats, donâ€™t want the truth, they only want lies. The truth is very bad for their mission!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śI will never testify against Trump.â€ť This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about â€śPresident Trump.â€ť Nice to know that some people still have â€śguts!â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	....his wife and father-in-law (who has the money?) off Scott Free. He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śMichael Cohen asks judge for no Prison Time.â€ť You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc., and not serve a long prison term? He makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and get.....
@realDonaldTrump	We would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall. Either way, people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally! We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary. Also, STOP THE DRUGS!
@realDonaldTrump	I am certain that, at some time in the future, President Xi and I, together with President Putin of Russia, will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race. The U.S. spent 716 Billion Dollars this year. Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship. He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change, on trade and far beyond, between our two great Nations. A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL!
@realDonaldTrump	Farmers will be a a very BIG and FAST beneficiary of our deal with China. They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately. We make the finest and cleanest product in the World, and that is what China wants. Farmers, I LOVE YOU!
@realDonaldTrump	My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one. Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward! Very good things will happen. We are dealing from great strength, but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. Level the field!
@realDonaldTrump	China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%.
@realDonaldTrump	....in the world. I want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving Americaâ€™s environment. But American taxpayers â€“ and American workers â€“ shouldnâ€™t pay to clean up others countriesâ€™ pollution.
@realDonaldTrump	I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago. The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters....
@realDonaldTrump	Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!
@realDonaldTrump	.....But if a fair deal is able to be made with China, one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done, I will happily sign. Let the negotiations begin. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	....I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN
@realDonaldTrump	......on seeing whether or not a REAL deal with China is actually possible. If it is, we will get it done. China is supposed to start buying Agricultural product and more immediately. President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will. But if not remember,......
@realDonaldTrump	The negotiations with China have already started. Unless extended, they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina. Bob Lighthizer will be working closely with Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro.....
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to being with the wonderful Bush family at Blair House today. The former First Lady will be coming over to the White House this morning to be given a tour of the Christmas decorations by Melania. The elegance & precision of the last two days have been remarkable!
@realDonaldTrump	Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted. The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices!
@realDonaldTrump	Looking forward to being with the Bush family. This is not a funeral, this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life. He will be missed!
@realDonaldTrump	.....considered to be the worst and most dangerous, addictive and deadly substance of them all. Last year over 77,000 people died from Fentanyl. If China cracks down on this â€śhorror drug,â€ť using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers, the results will be incredible!
@realDonaldTrump	One of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with President Xi of China is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly Fentanyl coming into the United States. It will now be considered a â€ścontrolled substance.â€ť This could be a game changer on what is.......
@realDonaldTrump	Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina. Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed!
@realDonaldTrump	.....China had agreed to start â€śimmediatelyâ€ť buying U.S. products.â€ť @business
@realDonaldTrump	â€śChina officially echoed President Donald Trumpâ€™s optimism over bilateral trade talks. Chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of U.S. Soybeans & Liquified Natural Gas, the first sign confirming the claims of President Donald Trump and the White House that......
@realDonaldTrump	.....China does not want Tariffs!
@realDonaldTrump	We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future....
@realDonaldTrump	My thoughts and prayers are with the @USMC crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of Japan. Thank you to @USForcesJapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts. Whatever you need, we are here for you. @IIIMEF
@realDonaldTrump	Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judgeâ€™s, Military, Vets, etc.) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen. Itâ€™s called Presidential Harassment!
@realDonaldTrump	Working hard, thank you! pic.twitter.com/3SoWTkZjP6
@realDonaldTrump	Doug Wead, a truly great presidential historian, had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history, the funeral service today of President Bush. Doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time! @LouDobbs
@realDonaldTrump	Totally clears the President. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	It is being reported that Leakin' James Comey was told by Department of Justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions. Total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous Administration. Force him to answer the questions under oath!
@realDonaldTrump	Hopefully Mitch McConnell will ask for a VOTE on Criminal Justice Reform. It is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support. It will also help a lot of people, save taxpayer dollars, and keep our communities safe. Go for it Mitch!
@realDonaldTrump	Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him. His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didnâ€™t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldnâ€™t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State!
@realDonaldTrump	....and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country, he will be a great addition to our team. I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration!
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating The Honorable William P. Barr for the position of Attorney General of the United States. As the former AG for George H.W. Bush....
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert, Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State, will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador. I want to congratulate Heather, and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	We will be doing a major Counter Report to the Mueller Report. This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States!
@realDonaldTrump	Today, we honor those who perished 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor, and we salute every veteran who served in World War II over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack. God Bless America!  http://45.wh.gov/AK2T95Â  pic.twitter.com/5hbLDrqg40
@realDonaldTrump	It has been incorrectly reported that Rudy Giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the Mueller Report. That is Fake News. Already 87 pages done, but obviously cannot complete until we see the final Witch Hunt Report.
@realDonaldTrump	China talks are going very well!
@realDonaldTrump	...the lying and leaking by the people doing the Report, & also Bruce Ohr (and his lovely wife Molly), Comey, Brennan, Clapper, & all of the many fired people of the FBI, be listed in the Report? Will the corruption within the DNC & Clinton Campaign be exposed?..And so much more!
@realDonaldTrump	....Foundation be listed at the top of the Report? Will the scathing document written about Lyinâ€™ James Comey, by the man in charge of the case, Rod Rosenstein (who also signed the FISA Warrant), be a big part of the Report? Isnâ€™t Rod therefore totally conflicted? Will all of....
@realDonaldTrump	.....overturned, 9-0, in the United States Supreme Court. Doing same thing to people now. Will all of the substantial & many contributions made by the 17 Angry Democrats to the Campaign of Crooked Hillary be listed in top of Report. Will the people that worked for the Clinton....
@realDonaldTrump	....Will Robert Muellerâ€™s big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his Republicans only Report. Will Andrew Weissmanâ€™s horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the Report. He wrongly destroyed peopleâ€™s lives, took down great companies, only to be........
@realDonaldTrump	Robert Mueller and Leakinâ€™ Lyinâ€™ James Comey are Best Friends, just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest. And bye the way, wasnâ€™t the woman in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi (who I do not know) in charge of â€ślegalâ€ť at the corrupt Clinton Foundation? A total Witch Hunt...
@realDonaldTrump	Arizona, together with our Military and Border Patrol, is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area. WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH. Big danger. Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	FAKE NEWS - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
@realDonaldTrump	Trish_Regan:  â€śDid the FBI follow protocol to obtain the FISA warrant? I donâ€™t think so. The Dossier was opposition research funded by opponents. Donâ€™t use Government resources to take down political foes. Weaponizing Government for gain.â€ť Is this really America? Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	Jerome Corsi: â€ťThis is not justice, this is not America. This is a political prosecution. The Special Prosecutor (Counsel), to get this plea deal, demanded I lie and violate the law. Theyâ€™re the criminals.â€ť He is not alone. 17 Angry Dems. People forced to lie. Sad!  @Trish_Regan
@realDonaldTrump	Statement from China: â€śThe teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. We are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days.â€ť I agree!
@realDonaldTrump	Does the Fake News Media ever mention the fact that Republicans, with the very important help of my campaign Rallies, WON THE UNITED STATES SENATE, 53 to 47? All I hear is that the Open Border Dems won the House. Senate alone approves judges & others. Big Republican Win!
@realDonaldTrump	It was my honor to attend todayâ€™s #ArmyNavyGame in Philadelphia. A GREAT game played all around by our HEROES. Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football on the win! pic.twitter.com/WDLkM6VE2T

@realDonaldTrump	Watched Da Nang Dick Blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in Vietnam (which he never saw). As the bullets whizzed by Da Nang Dicks head, as he was saving soldiers....
@realDonaldTrump	Very sad day & night in Paris. Maybe itâ€™s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? The U.S. was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThis is collusion illusion, there is no smoking gun here. At this late date, after all that we have gone through, after millions have been spent, we have no Russian Collusion. There is nothing impeachable here.â€ť @GeraldoRivera  Time for the Witch Hunt to END!
@realDonaldTrump	....I am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our Country! Date of transition to be determined.
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star General Mark Milley, Chief of Staff of the United States Army â€“ as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replacing General Joe Dunford, who will be retiring....
@realDonaldTrump	AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30,000,000), NO COLLUSION!
@realDonaldTrump	The idea of a European Military didnâ€™t work out too well in W.W. I or 2. But the U.S. was there for you, and always will be. All we ask is that you pay your fair share of NATO. Germany is paying 1% while the U.S. pays 4.3% of a much larger GDP - to protect Europe. Fairness!
@realDonaldTrump	The Paris Agreement isnâ€™t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting â€śWe Want Trump!â€ť Love France.
@realDonaldTrump	The Trump Administration has accomplished more than any other U.S. Administration in its first two (not even) years of existence, & we are having a great time doing it! All of this despite the Fake News Media, which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the Enemy of the People!
@realDonaldTrump	Leakinâ€™ James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day. His Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!
@realDonaldTrump	On 245  occasions, former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didnâ€™t know, didnâ€™t recall, or couldnâ€™t remember things when asked. Opened investigations on 4 Americans (not 2) - didnâ€™t know who signed off and didnâ€™t know Christopher Steele. All lies!
@realDonaldTrump	....which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obamaâ€™s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyerâ€™s liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śDemocrats canâ€™t find a Smocking Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comeyâ€™s testimony. No Smocking Gun...No Collusion.â€ť @FoxNews  Thatâ€™s because there was NO COLLUSION. So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,...
@realDonaldTrump	I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff. Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda. I will be making a decision soon!
@realDonaldTrump	Thanks to Leader McConnell for agreeing to bring a Senate vote on Criminal Justice this week! These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars. It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season.
@realDonaldTrump	"â€śI donâ€™t care what you think of the President...it cannot bleed over to the FBI...Comey is confirming there is bias in the FBI...â€ť  -Chris Swecker"
@realDonaldTrump	James Comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow Democrats to take back the White House in 2020. In other words, he is and has been a Democrat. Comey had no right heading the FBI at any time, but especially after his mind exploded!
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News has it purposely wrong. Many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position. Why wouldnâ€™t someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington. Please report news correctly. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	Very productive conversations going on with China! Watch for some important announcements!
@realDonaldTrump	Great job by Michael Anton on @foxandfriends. A true National Security expert!
@realDonaldTrump	....People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built. If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall. They know how important it is!
@realDonaldTrump	.....I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi. In 2006, Democrats voted for a Wall, and they were right to do so. Today, they no longer want Border Security. They will fight it at all cost, and Nancy must get votes for Speaker. But the Wall will get built...
@realDonaldTrump	....however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do NOT want Border Security. They want Open Borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease. Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way.......
@realDonaldTrump	.....Ice, Border Patrol and our Military have done a FANTASTIC job of securing our Southern Border. A Great Wall would be, however, a far easier & less expensive solution. We have already built large new sections & fully renovated others, making them like new. The Democrats,.....
@realDonaldTrump	Despite the large Caravans that WERE forming and heading to our Country, people have not been able to get through our newly built Walls, makeshift Walls & Fences, or Border Patrol Officers & Military. They are now staying in Mexico or going back to their original countries.......
@realDonaldTrump	â€śFormer FBI Director James Comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the Democrats paid for that phony Trump Dossier.â€ť @LouDobbs  Details on Tuesday night.
@realDonaldTrump	James Comeyâ€™s behind closed doors testimony reveals that â€śthere was not evidence of Campaign Collusionâ€ť with Russia when he left the FBI. In other words, the Witch Hunt is illegal and should never have been started!
@realDonaldTrump	.@FLOTUS Melania will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight on @FoxNews at 9:00pmE!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they canâ€™t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?
@realDonaldTrump	Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!

@realDonaldTrump	WITCH HUNT!
@realDonaldTrump	They gave General Flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the FBI said he didnâ€™t lie and they overrode the FBI. They want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements. Sad!......
@realDonaldTrump	....guilty even on a civil basis. Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me!
@realDonaldTrump	....stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance. Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not...
@realDonaldTrump	I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law. He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. It is called â€śadvice of counsel,â€ť and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made. That is why they get paid. Despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly......
@realDonaldTrump	I often stated, â€śOne way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.â€ť This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!
@realDonaldTrump	....I look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! John will be staying until the end of the year. He is a GREAT PATRIOT and I want to personally thank him for his service!
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management & Budget, will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff, replacing General John Kelly, who has served our Country with distinction. Mick has done an outstanding job while in the Administration....

@realDonaldTrump	China just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them. They have just suspended U.S. Tariff Hikes. U.S. is doing very well. China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen, and rather soon!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, 19,000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover, Peter S of the FBI, in charge of the Russia Hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News. Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	The pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard, run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who, like many others, never had a clue), is flat broke and out of business. Too bad. May it rest in peace!
@realDonaldTrump	Never in the history of our Country has the â€śpressâ€ť been more dishonest than it is today. Stories that should be good, are bad. Stories that should be bad, are horrible. Many stories, like with the REAL story on Russia, Clinton & the DNC, seldom get reported. Too bad!
@realDonaldTrump	.......The Trump Administration will be announcing the new Secretary of the Interior next week.
@realDonaldTrump	Secretary of the Interior @RyanZinke will be leaving the Administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years. Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation.......

@realDonaldTrump	As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!
@realDonaldTrump	For the record, there were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff. Mick M will do a GREAT job!
@realDonaldTrump	....The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, started as the â€śinsurance policyâ€ť long before I even got elected, is very bad for our Country. They are Entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. Nothing to do with Collusion. A Democrat Scam!
@realDonaldTrump	....a persecution of the President.â€ť  Daniel Henninger, The Wall Street Journal. Thank you, people are starting to see and understand what this Witch Hunt is all about. Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIt looks here as though General Flynnâ€™s defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to Donald Trump without quite knowing what that crime might be. It stops looking like prosecution and more looking like......
@realDonaldTrump	Required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of Rod Blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a Jerome Corsi. If that doesnâ€™t tell you something about what has been going on in our Country, nothing will. Very sad!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However, if you donâ€™t separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!
@realDonaldTrump	Judge Ken Starr, former Solicitor Generel & Independent Counsel, just stated that, after two years, â€śthere is no evidence or proof of collusionâ€ť & further that â€śthere is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the President.â€ť Thank you Judge. @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a â€śU.S. Military hero,â€ť Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @PeteHegseth @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	Remember, Michael Cohen only became a â€śRatâ€ť after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEYâ€™S OFFICE! Why didnâ€™t they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crookedâ€™s office?
@realDonaldTrump	So where are all the missing Text messages between fired FBI agents Peter S and the lovely Lisa Page, his lover. Just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean. What an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted Witch Hunt moves ever so slowly forward. Want them!
@realDonaldTrump	A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC & Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live. It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials. Should be tested in courts, canâ€™t be legal? Only defame & belittle! Collusion?
@realDonaldTrump	Today I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers & Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. I have authorized Secretary Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments. Our economy is stronger than everâ€“we stand with our Farmers!
@realDonaldTrump	Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!
@realDonaldTrump	It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike. Take the Victory!
@realDonaldTrump	The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable! Hurts families badly. We have a chance, working with the Democrats, to deliver great HealthCare! A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans!

@realDonaldTrump	Michael Isikoff was the first to report Dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the Dossier claims. The whole Russian Collusion thing was a HOAX, but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?
@realDonaldTrump	....WILL NEVER BE PROVEN AND ARE LIKELY FALSE.â€ť  Thank you to Michael Isikoff, Yahoo, for honesty. What this means is that the FISA WARRANTS and the whole Russian Witch Hunt is a Fraud and a Hoax which should be ended immediately. Also, it was paid for by Crooked Hillary & DNC!
@realDonaldTrump	Russia Dossier reporter now doubts dopey Christopher Steeleâ€™s claims! â€śWhen you get into the details of the Steele Dossier, the specific allegations, we have not seen the evidence to support them. Thereâ€™s good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations.....
@realDonaldTrump	Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. How was this allowed to happen?
@realDonaldTrump	Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous! Twitter, in fact, has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump. They have removed many names & greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. They have acknowledged-done NOTHING!
@realDonaldTrump	I hope the people over at the Fed will read todayâ€™s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also, donâ€™t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 Bâ€™s. Feel the market, donâ€™t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!
@realDonaldTrump	Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn. Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!
@realDonaldTrump	Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely & illegally deleted. Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest!
@realDonaldTrump	After historic victories against ISIS, itâ€™s time to bring our great young people home! pic.twitter.com/xoNjFzQFTp
@realDonaldTrump	....In any event, it goes on and on & the new AG, who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda), does little else but rant, rave & politic against me. Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of â€śjustice.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	...sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman, who has since resigned over horrific women abuse, when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. Shady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton, and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation......
@realDonaldTrump	The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc. Now, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by.....
@realDonaldTrump	We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to Border Security and the Military, the Democrats fight to the death. We won on the Military, which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	....This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it. In addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved. I look forward to signing this into law!
@realDonaldTrump	America is the greatest Country in the world and my job is to fight for ALL citizens, even those who have made mistakes. Congratulations to the Senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill....
@realDonaldTrump	....It will be beautiful and, at the same time, give our Country the security that our citizens deserve. It will go up fast and save us BILLIONS of dollars a month once completed!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it....
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to @MarthaMcSally on her appointment by Governor @DougDucey as the Great new Senator from Arizona - I have no doubt she will do a fantastic job!
@realDonaldTrump	....equipment. General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations. A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly. I greatly thank Jim for his service!
@realDonaldTrump	General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years. During Jimâ€™s tenure, tremendous progress has been made, especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting....

@realDonaldTrump	So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives & billions of $$$. Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying & killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran & other locals? Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong!
@realDonaldTrump	Congress just passed the Criminal Justice Reform Bill known as the #FirstStepAct. Congratulations! This is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody. When both parties work together we can keep our Country safer. A wonderful thing for the U.S.A.!!
@realDonaldTrump	When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didnâ€™t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!
@realDonaldTrump	With so much talk about the Wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol, ICE and our great Military. Remember the Caravans? Well, they didnâ€™t get through and none are forming or on their way. Border is tight. Fake News silent!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats, who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security, are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!
@realDonaldTrump	....Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us. I am building by far the most powerful military in the world. ISIS hits us they are doomed!
@realDonaldTrump	Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight.....
@realDonaldTrump	Getting out of Syria was no surprise. Iâ€™ve been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer. Russia, Iran, Syria & others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing there work. Time to come home & rebuild. #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIâ€™m proud of the President today to hear that he is declaring victory in Syria.â€ť Senator Rand Paul.  â€śI couldnâ€™t agree more with the presidents decision. By definition, this is the opposite of an Obama decision. Senator Mike Lee

@realDonaldTrump	Col. Jim Carafano on @IngrahamAngle â€śTrump has made the Middle East a better place. When Trump came into office, ISIS was running amuck in the Middle East. Over a million refugees poured into Western Europe - none of that is happening today. Thatâ€™s all due to Trump.â€ť

@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats now own the shutdown!
@realDonaldTrump	General Anthony Tata, author, â€śDark Winter.â€ť I think the President is making the exact right move in Syria. All the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from Syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on ISIS intelligence and gave rise to ISIS.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia - Never, just look at the facts. The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @SteveDaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on DESPERATELY NEEDED Border Security! Have my total support.
@realDonaldTrump	Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!
@realDonaldTrump	Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall, or Fence, and was unable to do so. Others also have tried. We will get it done, one way or the other!
@realDonaldTrump	Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!
@realDonaldTrump	House Republican Vote, 217-185.
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People donâ€™t want Open Borders and Crime!
@realDonaldTrump	No matter what happens today in the Senate, Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves. They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall. Not one Democrat voted yes, and we won big. I am very proud of you!
@realDonaldTrump	.....on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall. Properly designed and built Walls work, and the Democrats are lying when they say they donâ€™t. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing elseâ€™s that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. Itâ€™s like the wheel, there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone, & technology.....
@realDonaldTrump	Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes, but as shown in the House, good things happen. If enough Dems donâ€™t vote, it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday!
@realDonaldTrump	Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, last week live from the Oval Office, that the Republicans didnâ€™t have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won, 217-185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!
@realDonaldTrump	I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House!  #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	Senate adjourns until December 27th.
@realDonaldTrump	I won an election, said to be one of the greatest of all time, based on getting out of endless & costly foreign wars & also based on Strong Borders which will keep our Country safe. We fight for the borders of other countries, but we wonâ€™t fight for the borders of our own!
@realDonaldTrump	The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall. Let work begin!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be having lunch in White House residence with large group concerning Border Security.
@realDonaldTrump	....going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left. When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. Weâ€™re coming home!
@realDonaldTrump	I am in the White House, working hard. News reports concerning the Shutdown and Syria are mostly FAKE. We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay. On Syria, we were originally...

@realDonaldTrump	.....Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. I said NO and the game was over. #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE!
@realDonaldTrump	Senator Bob Corker just stated that, â€śIâ€™m so priveledged to serve in the Senate for twelve years, and thatâ€™s what I told the people of our state thatâ€™s what Iâ€™d do, serve for two terms.â€ť But that is Not True - wanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldnâ€™t endorse him.....
@realDonaldTrump	We signed two pieces of major legislation this week, Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill. These are two Big Deals, but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is â€śthe mistakeâ€ť of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars. It all began 19 years ago!
@realDonaldTrump	Unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in Indonesia. More than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for. We are praying for recovery and healing. America is with you!
@realDonaldTrump	I just had a long and productive call with President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey. We discussed ISIS, our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home. We also discussed heavily expanded Trade.
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!
@realDonaldTrump	The only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!
@realDonaldTrump	When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldnâ€™t, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!
@realDonaldTrump	I am in the Oval Office & just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars, & lives, will be saved!

@realDonaldTrump	I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. See? Isnâ€™t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!
@realDonaldTrump	The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point. The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted!
@realDonaldTrump	I never â€ślashed outâ€ť at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S., a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story, one of many, by the Fake News Media!
@realDonaldTrump	The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They donâ€™t have a feel for the Market, they donâ€™t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who canâ€™t score because he has no touch - he canâ€™t putt!
@realDonaldTrump	AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember, he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH &  sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker.
@realDonaldTrump	....We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S., and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!
@realDonaldTrump	To those few Senators who think I donâ€™t like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO. What I donâ€™t like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade...
@realDonaldTrump	Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence. It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it. Desperately needed!
@realDonaldTrump	President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria....and he is a man who can do it plus, Turkey is right â€śnext door.â€ť Our troops are coming home!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe President has been remarkable. I do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment, and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is.â€ť Thank you to Tammy Bruce and Steve Hilton. Presidential Harassment has been with me from the beginning!
@realDonaldTrump	The most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border. We need Border Security, and as EVERYONE knows, you canâ€™t have Border Security without a Wall. The Drones & Technology are just bells and whistles. Safety for America!
@realDonaldTrump	Mitch McConnell just told a group of people, and me, that he has been in the U.S. Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best & most productive of his career. Tax & Regulation Cuts, VA Choice, Farm Bill, Criminal Justice Reform, Judgeships & much more. Great!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIt should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and heâ€™s right...The generals still donâ€™t get the mistake.â€ť  @RandPaul
@realDonaldTrump	I hope everyone, even the Fake News Media, is having a great Christmas! Our Country is doing very well. We are securing our Borders, making great new Trade Deals, and bringing our Troops Back Home. We are finally putting America First. MERRY CHRISTMAS!  #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump	CNN & others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany. If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign. Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!
@realDonaldTrump	This isnâ€™t about the Wall, everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99.9%). This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump & the Republicans have a win. They may have the 10 Senate votes, but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	Brad Blakeman: â€śThe American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. The President says look, this is your neighborhood, youâ€™ve got to stand up to protect yourselves. Donâ€™t always look to America.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	I totally agree! https://twitter.com/BarackObama/status/30091811594698752Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śBorder Patrol Agents want the Wall.â€ť Democratâ€™s say they donâ€™t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they donâ€™t want ICE. They donâ€™t have much to campaign on, do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!
@realDonaldTrump	The reason the DACA for Wall deal didnâ€™t get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case. After ruling, Dems dropped deal - and thatâ€™s where we are today, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall.
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting & expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years, a U.S. record!
@realDonaldTrump	Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking,Gang Members & Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?
@realDonaldTrump	Just returned from visiting our troops in Iraq and Germany. One thing is certain, we have incredible people representing our Country - people that know how to win!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Sean Parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to Melania and I in Iraq and Germany. Great things are happening!
@realDonaldTrump	.....Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!
@realDonaldTrump	.....close the Southern Border. Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico. Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border......
@realDonaldTrump	....The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a â€śprofit making operation.â€ť We build a Wall or.....
@realDonaldTrump	We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!
@realDonaldTrump	2018 is being called â€śTHE YEAR OF THE WORKERâ€ť by Steve Moore, co-author of â€śTrumponomics.â€ť It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the â€śbest job market in 50 years, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	For those that naively ask why didnâ€™t the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year, it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES, and they will gives us â€śNONEâ€ť for Border Security! Now we have to do it the hard way, with a Shutdown. Too bad! @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	...children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadnâ€™t given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!
@realDonaldTrump	Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They canâ€™t. If we had a Wall, they wouldnâ€™t even try! The two.....
@realDonaldTrump	Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made!
@realDonaldTrump	I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security. From what I hear, they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover, Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!
@realDonaldTrump	President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing, slightly larger version!
@realDonaldTrump	Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!
@realDonaldTrump	Veterans on President Trumpâ€™s handling of Border Security - 62% Approval Rating. On being a strong leader - 59%.  AP Poll. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIt turns out to be true now, that the Department of Justice and the FBI, under President Obama, rigged the investigation for Hillary and really turned the screws on Trump, and now it looks like in a corrupt & illegal way. The facts are out now. Whole Hoax exposed. @JesseBWatters
@realDonaldTrump	â€śAbsolutely nothingâ€ť (on Russian Collusion). Kimberley Strassel, The Wall Street Journal. The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics. The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats!
@realDonaldTrump	HAPPY NEW YEAR! pic.twitter.com/bHoPDPQ7G6
@realDonaldTrump	....Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administration in history. These are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country! Very Unfair!
@realDonaldTrump	Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors!? Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace! 360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from....
@realDonaldTrump	Itâ€™s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesnâ€™t work. It does, and properly built, almost 100%! They say itâ€™s old technology - but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!
@realDonaldTrump	Iâ€™m in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, Iâ€™ll get it built, and Fast!
@realDonaldTrump	I am the only person in America who could say that, â€śIâ€™m bringing our great troops back home, with victory,â€ť and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever, they would still be unhappy!
@realDonaldTrump	I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an â€śOpen Wound,â€ť where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now!
@realDonaldTrump	.....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS, remember!
@realDonaldTrump	...I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places. Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!
@realDonaldTrump	If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero. ISIS is mostly gone, weâ€™re slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants......
@realDonaldTrump	An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media. Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides). Makes sense to me!
@realDonaldTrump	Do you think itâ€™s just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śKim Jong Un says North Korea will not make or test nuclear weapons, or give them to others - & he is ready to meet President Trump anytime.â€ť PBS News Hour. I also look forward to meeting with Chairman Kim who realizes so well that North Korea possesses great economic potential!
@realDonaldTrump	Washington Examiner - â€śMAGA list: 205 â€historic resultsâ€™ help Trump make case for 2020 re-election.â€ť  True!
@realDonaldTrump	Gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. This would be good!
@realDonaldTrump	Border Security and the Wall â€śthingâ€ť and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Letâ€™s make a deal?
@realDonaldTrump	"Congratulations to President @JairBolsonaro who just made a great inauguration speech - the U.S.A. is with you!"
@realDonaldTrump	One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śGeneralâ€ť McChrystal got fired like a dog by Obama. Last assignment a total bust. Known for big, dumb mouth. Hillary lover! https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/1079824312708808710Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats, much as I suspected, have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	Happy New Year!
@realDonaldTrump	HAPPY NEW YEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING THE HATERS AND THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA! 2019 WILL BE A FANTASTIC YEAR FOR THOSE NOT SUFFERING FROM TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME. JUST CALM DOWN AND ENJOY THE RIDE, GREAT THINGS ARE HAPPENING FOR OUR COUNTRY!
@realDonaldTrump	Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a very good and talented guy, has a great new book just out, â€śWhy We Fight.â€ť Lots of insight - Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	...Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats will probably submit a Bill, being cute as always, which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security, namely the Wall. You see, without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech â€śstuffâ€ť is just, by comparison, meaningless bells & whistles...
@realDonaldTrump	MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL through the many billions of dollars a year that the U.S.A. is saving through the new Trade Deal, the USMCA, that will replace the horrendous NAFTA Trade Deal, which has so badly hurt our Country. Mexico & Canada will also thrive - good for all!
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!
@realDonaldTrump	Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didnâ€™t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country, but canâ€™t because Dems are blocking them, some for two years-historic record. Passed committees, but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!
@realDonaldTrump	The RNC has a great Chairwoman in Ronna McDaniel and the @GOP has never been stronger. We achieved historic wins with her help last year! #MAGAđź‡şđź‡¸
@realDonaldTrump	The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!
@realDonaldTrump	The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they canâ€™t win based on all of the achievements of â€śTrump,â€ť so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!

@realDonaldTrump	Sadly, there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	...I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Letâ€™s get it done!
@realDonaldTrump	Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people â€“ this is the first and most important duty of government...
@realDonaldTrump	The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. Iâ€™m sure he is a fine man, but I donâ€™t know Jim, and never met him. Patrick Shanahan, who is Acting Secretary of Defense, is doing a great job!

@realDonaldTrump	GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!
@realDonaldTrump	How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?
@realDonaldTrump	As I have stated many times, if the Democrats take over the House or Senate, there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate, they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they canâ€™t win in 2020, too much success!
@realDonaldTrump	....President Trump deserves a lot of credit, but again, you have the anti-Trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	Michael Pillsbury interviewed by @cvpayne: â€śThey have the motive of making the President look bad â€“ instead of President Trump being portrayed as a HERO. The first President to take China on, itâ€™s 20 years overdue....
@realDonaldTrump	V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House. Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer, or to our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	"â€śFormer @NYTimes editor Jill Abramson rips paper's â€unmistakably anti-Trumpâ€™ bias.â€ť Ms. Abramson is 100% correct. Horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write. Hence the term Fake News, Enemy of the People, and Opposition Party!"
@realDonaldTrump	Great Tweet today by Tyler Q. Houlton @SpoxDHS on the #FakeNews being put out by @CNN, a proud member of the Opposition Party. @TSA is doing a great job!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid, but they donâ€™t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!
@realDonaldTrump	We are working hard at the Border, but we need a WALL!  In 2018, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized, 17,000 adults arrested with criminal records, and 6000 gang members, including MS-13, apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.
@realDonaldTrump	I donâ€™t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats, I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go, where are the Dems?
@realDonaldTrump	Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama & the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine & settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats could solve the Shutdown problem in a very short period of time. All they have to do is approve REAL Border Security (including a Wall), something which everyone, other than drug dealers, human traffickers and criminals, want very badly! This would be so easy to do!
@realDonaldTrump	Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border. Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Kanye West for your nice words. Criminal Justice Reform is now law - passed in a very bipartisan way!
@realDonaldTrump	Great new book by Dr. Robert Jeffress, â€śChoosing the Extraordinary Life.â€ť Get it and enjoy!  @LouDobbs
@realDonaldTrump	V.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger & less obtrusive. Good solution, and made in the U.S.A.
@realDonaldTrump	Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole. We have just killed the leader of that attack, Jamal al-Badawi. Our work against al Qaeda continues. We will never stop in our fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism!
@realDonaldTrump	Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President El-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future!
@realDonaldTrump	....The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end, crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked...â€ť Barrack Obama, 2005. I voted, when I was a Senator, to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in...â€ť Hillary Clinton, 2015.
@realDonaldTrump	Will be going to Camp David tomorrow morning for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with @WhiteHouse senior staff.
@realDonaldTrump	AP-NORC POLL: â€śImmigration among the top concerns in 2019.â€ť People want to stop drugs and criminals at the Border. Want Border Security! Tell the Dems to do the inevitable now, rather than later. The wait is costly and dangerous!

@realDonaldTrump	â€śJobs up big, plus 312,000. Record number working. Manufacturing best in 20 years (Previous administration said this could not happen). Hispanic unemployment lowest ever. Dow plus 747 (for day).â€ť @DRUDGE_REPORT

@realDonaldTrump	The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria. No different from my original statements, we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!.....
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman Adam Smith, the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just stated, â€śYes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. Itâ€™s been done a number of times.â€ť No doubt, but letâ€™s get our deal done in Congress!
@realDonaldTrump	....The Fake News Media in our Country is the real Opposition Party. It is truly the Enemy of the People! We must bring honesty back to journalism and reporting!
@realDonaldTrump	...The Fake News will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the Trump Administration, and me, look as bad as possible. They use non-existent sources & write stories that are total fiction. Our Country is doing so well, yet this is a sad day in America!
@realDonaldTrump	With all of the success that our Country is having, including the just released jobs numbers which are off the charts, the Fake News & totally dishonest Media concerning me and my presidency has never been worse. Many have become crazed lunatics who have given up on the TRUTH!...
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to a truly great football team, the Clemson Tigers, on an incredible win last night against a powerful Alabama team. A big win also for the Great State of South Carolina. Look forward to seeing the team, and their brilliant coach, for the second time at the W.H.
@realDonaldTrump	Talks with China are going very well!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe President is the biggest and best supporter of the Steel Industry in many years. We are now doing really well. The Tariffs let us compete. Was unfair that the Steel Industry lost its jobs to unfair trade laws. Very positive outcome.â€ť Mark Glyptis, United Steelworkers
@realDonaldTrump	Economic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration, rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. That would have been SO EASY! Still, markets up BIG since 2016 Election!
@realDonaldTrump	Endless Wars, especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago, & those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing, will eventually come to a glorious end!
@realDonaldTrump	Just left a meeting with Chuck and Nancy, a total waste of time. I asked what is going to happen in 30 days if I quickly open things up, are you going to approve Border Security which includes a Wall or Steel Barrier? Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye, nothing else works!

@realDonaldTrump	Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Country is doing so well in so many ways. Great jobs numbers, with a record setting December. We are rebuilding our military. Vets finally have Choice & Accountability. Economy & GDP are strong. Tax & Reg cuts historic. Trade deals great. But we MUST fix our Southern Border!

@realDonaldTrump	There is GREAT unity with the Republicans in the House and Senate, despite the Fake News Media working in overdrive to make the story look otherwise. The Opposition Party & the Dems know we must have Strong Border Security, but donâ€™t want to give â€śTrumpâ€ť another one of many wins!
@realDonaldTrump	Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I â€śslammed the table & walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum.â€ť Because I knew he would say that, and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security, I politely said bye-bye and left, no slamming!
@realDonaldTrump	Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon, somewhat of a White House tradition or custom, to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mainstream Media has NEVER been more dishonest than it is now. NBC and MSNBC are going Crazy. They report stories, purposely, the exact opposite of the facts. They are truly the Opposition Party working with the Dems. May even be worse than Fake News CNN, if that is possible!
@realDonaldTrump	.@CNN called a San Diego news station (@KUSINews) for negative reports on the Wall. When the station said that Walls work, CNN no longer had interest. #FakeNews pic.twitter.com/IDyXqmDsPq

@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media keeps saying we havenâ€™t built any NEW WALL. Below is a section just completed on the Border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service! pic.twitter.com/UAAGXl5Byr
@realDonaldTrump	...The Steel Barrier, or Wall, should have been built by previous administrations long ago. They never got it done - I will. Without it, our Country cannot be safe. Criminals, Gangs, Human Traffickers, Drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!
@realDonaldTrump	Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand, an invasion! I have been there numerous times - The Democrats, Cryinâ€™ Chuck and Nancy donâ€™t know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY....
@realDonaldTrump	H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship. We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	I often said during rallies, with little variation, that â€śMexico will pay for the Wall.â€ť We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico.

@realDonaldTrump	We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their â€śvacationsâ€ť and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!
@realDonaldTrump	....I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!
@realDonaldTrump	I just watched a Fake reporter from the Amazon Washington Post say the White House is â€śchaotic, there does not seem to be a strategy for this Shutdown. There is no plan.â€ť The Fakes always like talking Chaos, there is NONE. In fact, thereâ€™s almost nobody in the W.H. but me, and...
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.
@realDonaldTrump	23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants. Border arrests are up 240%. In the Great State of Texas, between 2011 & 2018, there were a total of 292,000 crimes by illegal aliens, 539 murders, 32,000 assaults, 3,426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown, while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you!
@realDonaldTrump	Lyinâ€™ James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter S and his lover, agent Lisa Page, & more, all disgraced and/or fired and caught in the act. These are just some of the losers that tried to do a number on your President. Part of the Witch Hunt. Remember the â€śinsurance policy?â€ť This is it!
@realDonaldTrump	I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, & as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!
@realDonaldTrump	.....who is being totally protected by his best friend, Bob Mueller, & the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton, her Campaign, and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch!
@realDonaldTrump	....the FBI was in complete turmoil (see N.Y. Post) because of Comeyâ€™s poor leadership and the way he handled the Clinton mess (not to mention his usurpation of powers from the Justice Department). My firing of James Comey was a great day for America. He was a Crooked Cop......
@realDonaldTrump	...Funny thing about James Comey. Everybody wanted him fired, Republican and Democrat alike. After the rigged & botched Crooked Hillary investigation, where she was interviewed on July 4th Weekend, not recorded or sworn in, and where she said she didnâ€™t know anything (a lie),....
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyinâ€™ James Comey, a total sleaze!
@realDonaldTrump	....Likewise, do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia, Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS!
@realDonaldTrump	Starting the long overdue pullout from Syria while hitting the little remaining ISIS territorial caliphate hard, and from many directions. Will attack again from existing nearby base if it reforms. Will devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds. Create 20 mile safe zone....

@realDonaldTrump	Iâ€™m in the White House, waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!
@realDonaldTrump	The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are saying that DACA is not worth it and donâ€™t want to include in talks. Many Hispanics will be coming over to the Republican side, watch!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed by Jeanine Pirro at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Watch @JesseBWatters before and @greggutfeld after. All terrific people. I am in the White House waiting for Cryinâ€™ Chuck and Nancy to call so we can start helping our Country both at the Border and from within!
@realDonaldTrump	....I am doing exactly what I pledged to do, and what I was elected to do by the citizens of our great Country. Just as I promised, I am fighting for YOU!
@realDonaldTrump	For decades, politicians promised to secure the border, fix our trade deals, bring back our factories, get tough on China, move the Embassy to Jerusalem, make NATO pay their fair share, and so much else - only to do NOTHING (or worse)....
@realDonaldTrump	Spoke w/ President Erdogan of Turkey to advise where we stand on all matters including our last two weeks of success in fighting the remnants of ISIS, and 20 mile safe zone. Also spoke about economic development between the U.S. & Turkey - great potential to substantially expand!

@realDonaldTrump	So sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor whose reporting, I understand, is far more accurate than the reporting in his lobbyist newspaper, the Amazon Washington Post. Hopefully the paper will soon be placed in better & more responsible hands!
@realDonaldTrump	Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamburgers etc. Within one hour, it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters!
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations @ClemsonFB! pic.twitter.com/w8viax0OWY
@realDonaldTrump	Why is Nancy Pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not?
@realDonaldTrump	Polls are now showing that people are beginning to understand the Humanitarian Crisis and Crime at the Border. Numbers are going up fast, over 50%. Democrats will soon be known as the Party of Crime. Ridiculous that they donâ€™t want Border Security!
@realDonaldTrump	A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall, or Steel Barrier, will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!
@realDonaldTrump	Volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They will be making Electric Cars. Congratulations to Chattanooga and Tennessee on a job well done. A big win!
@realDonaldTrump	Just announced that Veterans unemployment has reached an 18 year low, really good news for our Vets and their families. Will soon be an all time low! Do you think the media will report on this and all of the other great economic news?
@realDonaldTrump	The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyinâ€™ James Comey and the so-called â€śleadersâ€ť of the FBI. Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!
@realDonaldTrump	It is becoming more and more obvious that the Radical Democrats are a Party of open borders and crime. They want nothing to do with the major Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border. #2020!
@realDonaldTrump	There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world, with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	So funny to watch Schumer groveling. He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times - UNTIL I FIRED HIM!
@realDonaldTrump	The Left has become totally unhinged. They no longer care what is Right for our Countrty!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border, and the Shutdown, tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M., live from the @WhiteHouse.
@realDonaldTrump	AMERICA FIRST!
@realDonaldTrump	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Never seen the Republican Party so unified. No â€śCaveâ€ť on the issue of Border and National Security. A beautiful thing to see, especially when you hear the new rhetoric spewing from the mouths of the Democrats who talk Open Border, High Taxes and Crime. Stop Criminals & Drugs now!
@realDonaldTrump	Kevin Corke, @FoxNews â€śDonâ€™t forget, Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud, and as recently as this week, the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars....â€ť  Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law!
@realDonaldTrump	Another big Caravan heading our way. Very hard to stop without a Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śItâ€™s the Democrats keeping everything closed.â€ť @JimInhofe  So true!
@realDonaldTrump	Why would Nancy Pelosi leave the Country with other Democrats on a seven day excursion when 800,000 great people are not getting paid. Also, could somebody please explain to Nancy & her â€śbig donorsâ€ť in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in!
@realDonaldTrump	Border rancher: â€śWeâ€™ve found prayer rugs out here. Itâ€™s unreal.â€ť  Washington Examiner   People coming across the Southern Border from many countries, some of which would be a big surprise.
@realDonaldTrump	Gregg Jarrett: â€śMuellerâ€™s prosecutors knew the â€śDossierâ€ť was the product of bias and deception.â€ť It was a Fake, just like so much news coverage in our Country. Nothing but a Witch Hunt, from beginning to end!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIn 2018 alone, 20,000 illegal aliens with criminal records were apprehended trying to cross the Border, and there was a 122% increase in fentanyl being smuggled between ports of entry. Last month alone, more than 20,000 minors were smuggled into the U.S.â€ť @seanhannity
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Amy Kremer, Women for Trump Co-Founder, for doing such a great interview with Martha MacCallum...and by the way, women have the lowest unemployment numbers in many decades - at the highest pay ever. Proud of that!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be live from the White House at 4:00 P.M.
@realDonaldTrump	Mexico is doing NOTHING to stop the Caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the United States. We stopped the last two - many are still in Mexico but canâ€™t get through our Wall, but it takes a lot of Border Agents if there is no Wall. Not easy!
@realDonaldTrump	Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up), as highlighted by the disgraceful Buzzfeed story & the even more disgraceful coverage!
@realDonaldTrump	The Economy is one of the best in our history, with unemployment at a 50 year low, and the Stock Market ready to again break a record (set by us many times) - & all you heard yesterday, based on a phony story, was Impeachment. You want to see a Stock Market Crash, Impeach Trump!
@realDonaldTrump	.@newtgingrich just stated that there has been no president since Abraham Lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite President, me! At the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be leaving for Dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News is truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
@realDonaldTrump	Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited â€śDossier,â€ť paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research), on which the entire Russian probe is based! A very sad day for journalism, but a great day for our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Just a son who loves his Dad. Nice! https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/971870502204727298Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The Media is not giving us credit for the tremendous progress we have made with North Korea. Think of where we were at the end of the Obama Administration compared to now. Great meeting this week with top Reps. Looking forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at end of February!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you David! https://twitter.com/DavidWohl/status/1086461107244490752Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Donâ€™t forget, we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly, and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building, after all, is what I do best, even when money is not readily available!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19%, to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone, and they want Security, which can only be gotten with a Wall.
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy, I am still thinking about the State of the Union speech, there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the Shutdown, security is no problem), and my written acceptance. While a contract is a contract, Iâ€™ll get back to you soon!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi has behaved so irrationally & has gone so far to the left that she has now officially become a Radical Democrat. She is so petrified of the â€śleftiesâ€ť in her party that she has lost control...And by the way, clean up the streets in San Francisco, they are disgusting!
@realDonaldTrump	No, Amnesty is not a part of my offer. It is a 3 year extension of DACA. Amnesty will be used only on a much bigger deal, whether on immigration or something else. Likewise there will be no big push to remove the 11,000,000 plus people who are here illegally-but be careful Nancy!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They donâ€™t see crime & drugs, they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.
@realDonaldTrump	Be careful and try staying in your house. Large parts of the Country are suffering from  tremendous amounts of snow and near record setting cold. Amazing how big this system is. Wouldnâ€™t be bad to have a little of that good old fashioned Global Warming right now!
@realDonaldTrump	Always heard that as President, â€śitâ€™s all about the economy!â€ť Well, we have one of the best economies in the history of our Country. Big GDP, lowest unemployment, companies coming back to the U.S. in BIG numbers, great new trade deals happening, & more. But LITTLE media mention!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats are kidding themselves (they donâ€™t really believe it!) if they say you can stop Crime, Drugs, Human Trafficking and Caravans without a Wall or Steel Barrier. Stop playing games and give America the Security it deserves. A Humanitarian Crisis!
@realDonaldTrump	Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are â€śimmoral,â€ť why isnâ€™t she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico, even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging. Let millions of unchecked â€śstrangersâ€ť just flow into the U.S.
@realDonaldTrump	China posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies. Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal, and stop playing around!

@realDonaldTrump	Last year was the best year for American Manufacturing job growth since 1997, or 21 years. The previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the U.S., â€śyou would need a magic wand.â€ť I guess I found the MAGIC WAND - and it is only getting better!

@realDonaldTrump	To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say, THANK YOU - YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS! We must now work together, after decades of abuse, to finally fix the Humanitarian, Criminal & Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!

They relied heavily on the unverified Trump â€śDossierâ€ť paid for by the DNC & Clinton Campaign, & funded through a...
@realDonaldTrump	The reason Sarah Sanders does not go to the â€śpodiumâ€ť much anymore is that the press covers her so rudely & inaccurately, in particular certain members of the press. I told her not to bother, the word gets out anyway! Most will never cover us fairly & hence, the term, Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States has a great economic story to tell. Number one in the World, by far!
@realDonaldTrump	Last time I went to Davos, the Fake News said I should not go there. This year, because of the Shutdown, I decided not to go, and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!
@realDonaldTrump	Never seen @senatemajldr and Republicans so united on an issue as they are on the Humanitarian Crisis & Security on our Southern Border. If we create a Wall or Barrier which prevents Criminals and Drugs from flowing into our Country, Crime will go down by record numbers!
@realDonaldTrump	Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trumpâ€™s approval rating among Latinos going to 50%, an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you, working hard!
@realDonaldTrump	FBI top lawyer confirms â€śunusual steps.â€ť They relied on the Clinton Campaignâ€™s Fake & Unverified â€śDossier,â€ť which is illegal. â€śThat has corrupted them. That has enabled them to gather evidence by UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS, and thatâ€™s what they did to the President.â€ť Judge Napolitano
@realDonaldTrump	Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security. With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier, Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S. The Dems know this but want to play political games. Must finally be done correctly. No Cave!

@realDonaldTrump	We have turned away, at great expense, two major Caravans, but a big one has now formed and is coming. At least 8000 people! If we had a powerful Wall, they wouldnâ€™t even try to make the long and dangerous journey. Build the Wall and Crime will Fall!
@realDonaldTrump	21 days goes very quickly. Negotiations with Democrats will start immediately. Will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in. The case for National Security has been greatly enhanced by what has been happening at the Border & through dialogue. We will build the Wall!

@realDonaldTrump	After all that I have done for the Military, our great Veterans, Judges (99), Justices (2), Tax & Regulation Cuts, the Economy, Energy, Trade & MUCH MORE, does anybody really think I wonâ€™t build the WALL? Done more in first two years than any President! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Never thought Iâ€™d say this but I think @johnrobertsFox and @GillianHTurner @FoxNews have even less understanding of the Wall negotiations than the folks at FAKE NEWS CNN & NBC! Look to final results! Donâ€™t know how my poll numbers are so good, especially up 19% with Hispanics?

@realDonaldTrump	....meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the Oval Office. No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi, and I, meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points. Very comprehensive transaction....
@realDonaldTrump	Chinaâ€™s top trade negotiators are in the U.S. meeting with our representatives. Meetings are going well with good intent and spirit on both sides. China does not want an increase in Tariffs and feels they will do much better if they make a deal. They are correct. I will be......
@realDonaldTrump	With Murders up 33% in Mexico, a record, why wouldnâ€™t any sane person want to build a Wall! Construction has started and will not stop until it is finished. @LouDobbs @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!
@realDonaldTrump	Large sections of WALL have already been built with much more either under construction or ready to go. Renovation of existing WALLS is also a very big part of the plan to finally, after many decades, properly Secure Our Border. The Wall is getting done one way or the other!
@realDonaldTrump	So great to watch & listen to all these people who write books & talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning, and how I should be doing â€śIT.â€ť As I take it all in, I then sit back, look around, & say â€śgee, Iâ€™m in the White House, & theyâ€™re not!

@realDonaldTrump	Best January for the DOW in over 30 years. We have, by far, the strongest economy in the world!
@realDonaldTrump	....after 18 long years. Syria was loaded with ISIS until I came along. We will soon have destroyed 100% of the Caliphate, but will be watching them closely. It is now time to start coming home and, after many years, spending our money wisely. Certain people must get smart!
@realDonaldTrump	I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan, the â€śEndless Warsâ€ť of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said, very strongly, that these wars must finally end. We spend $50 Billion a year in Afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace...

@realDonaldTrump	Nellie Ohr, the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr, was long ago investigating for pay (GPS Fusion) members of my family, feeding it to her husband who was then giving it to the FBI, even though it was created by ousted & discredited Christopher Steele. Illegal! WITCH HUNT
@realDonaldTrump	Just out: The big deal, very mysterious Don jr telephone calls, after the innocent Trump Tower meeting, that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me), were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. They were made to friends & business associates of Don. Really sad!
@realDonaldTrump	Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Countryâ€™s history. Thanks, as always, for a job well done!
@realDonaldTrump	Great morning at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida with @JackNicklaus and @TigerWoods! pic.twitter.com/mdPN4yvS8e
@realDonaldTrump	With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country, Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall, there is no Security. Human Trafficking, Drugs and Criminals of all dimensions - KEEP OUT!
@realDonaldTrump	Everyone is asking how Tiger played yesterday. The answer is Great! He was long, straight & putted fantastically well. He shot a 64. Tiger is back & will be winning Majors again! Not surprisingly, Jack also played really well. His putting is amazing! Jack & Tiger like each other.
@realDonaldTrump	I will be interviewed Sunday morning on @FaceTheNation and prior to the Super Bowl on @CBS at 3:30 P.M. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Ed Gillespie, who ran for Governor of the Great State of Virginia against Ralph Northam, must now be thinking Malpractice and Dereliction of Duty with regard to his Opposition Research Staff. If they find that terrible picture before the election, he wins by 20 points!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrat Governor Ralph Northam of Virginia just stated, â€śI believe that I am not either of the people in that photo.â€ť This was 24 hours after apologizing for appearing in the picture and after making the most horrible statement on â€śsuperâ€ť late term abortion. Unforgivable!
@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce that David Bernhardt, Acting Secretary of the Interior, will be nominated as Secretary of the Interior. David has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived, and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed!

@realDonaldTrump	I see Schumer is already criticizing my State of the Union speech, even though he hasnâ€™t seen it yet. Heâ€™s just upset that he didnâ€™t win the Senate, after spending a fortune, like he thought he would. Too bad we werenâ€™t given more credit for the Senate win by the media!
@realDonaldTrump	Tremendous numbers of people are coming up through Mexico in the hopes of flooding our Southern Border. We have sent additional military. We will build a Human Wall if necessary. If we had a real Wall, this would be a non-event!

@realDonaldTrump	Democrats at the top are killing the Great State of Virginia. If the three failing pols were Republicans, far stronger action would be taken. Virginia will come back HOME Republican) in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	....The Dems and their committees are going â€śnuts.â€ť The Republicans never did this to President Obama, there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces, after having found zero Russian Collusion, that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life, both financial and personal, even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment....
@realDonaldTrump	I was a big fan of Frank Robinson, both as a great player and man. He was the first African American manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did. He will he missed!

@realDonaldTrump	...It is all a GIANT AND ILLEGAL HOAX, developed long before the election itself, but used as an excuse by the Democrats as to why Crooked Hillary Clinton lost the Election! Someday the Fake News Media will turn honest & report that Donald J. Trump was actually a GREAT Candidate!
@realDonaldTrump	The mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the VERY important Senate Intelligence Committee, after two years of intensive study and access to Intelligence that only they could get, just stated that they have found NO COLLUSION between â€śTrumpâ€ť & Russia....
@realDonaldTrump	Now we find out that Adam Schiff was spending time together in Aspen with Glenn Simpson of GPS Fusion, who wrote the fake and discredited Dossier, even though Simpson was testifying before Schiff. John Solomon of @thehill
@realDonaldTrump	Not only did Senator Burrâ€™s Committee find No Collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia, itâ€™s important because they interviewed 200 witnesses and 300,000 pages of documents, & the Committee has direct access to intelligence information thatâ€™s Classified. @GreggJarrett
@realDonaldTrump	Highly respected Senator Richard Burr, Chairman of Senate Intelligence, said today that, after an almost two year investigation, he saw no evidence of Russia collusion. â€śWe donâ€™t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia.â€ť  Thank you!

@realDonaldTrump	I think it is very important for the Democrats to press forward with their Green New Deal. It would be great for the so-called â€śCarbon Footprintâ€ť to permanently eliminate all Planes, Cars, Cows, Oil, Gas & the Military - even if no other country would do the same. Brilliant!
@realDonaldTrump	Today Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas, joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate, or has she decided that after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL, Liz!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats just donâ€™t seem to want Border Security. They are fighting Border Agents recommendations. If you believe news reports, they are not offering much for the Wall. They look to be making this a campaign issue. The Wall will get built one way or the other!
@realDonaldTrump	We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks. If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election, the U.S. would be in a Depression right now! We were heading down, and donâ€™t let the Democrats sound bites fool you!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!
@realDonaldTrump	It was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both Syria and Afghanistan. Their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high. They will recoverer & be back very soon. America loves them. Walter Reed Hospital is AMAZING - Thank you all!
@realDonaldTrump	North Korea, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, will become a great Economic Powerhouse. He may surprise some but he wonâ€™t surprise me, because I have gotten to know him & fully understand how capable he is. North Korea will become a different kind of Rocket - an Economic one!
@realDonaldTrump	My representatives have just left North Korea after a very productive meeting and an agreed upon time and date for the second Summit with Kim Jong Un. It will take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, on February 27 & 28. I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim & advancing the cause of peace!
@realDonaldTrump	The U.S. will soon control 100% of ISIS territory in Syria. @CNN (do you believe this?).
@realDonaldTrump	Well, it happened again. Amy Klobuchar announced that she is running for President, talking proudly of fighting global warming while standing in a virtual blizzard of snow, ice and freezing temperatures. Bad timing. By the end of her speech she looked like a Snowman(woman)!
@realDonaldTrump	The Border Committee Democrats are behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally. Not only are they unwilling to give dollars for the obviously needed Wall (they overrode recommendations of Border Patrol experts), but they donâ€™t even want to take muderers into custody! Whatâ€™s going on?
@realDonaldTrump	â€śPresident is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency. There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976, and 31 right now that are currently active, so this is hardly unprecedented.â€ť Congressman @tommcclintock
@realDonaldTrump	....The fact is, when I took over as President, our Country was a mess. Depleted Military, Endless Wars, a potential War with North Korea, V.A., High Taxes & too many Regulations, Border, Immigration & HealthCare problems, & much more. I had no choice but to work very long hours!
@realDonaldTrump	The media was able to get my work schedule, something very easy to do, but it should have been reported as a positive, not negative. When the term Executive Time is used, I am generally working, not relaxing. In fact, I probably work more hours than almost any past President.....
@realDonaldTrump	It was a very bad week for the Democrats, with the GREAT economic numbers, The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now, with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee, I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!
@realDonaldTrump	I donâ€™t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!
@realDonaldTrump	Gallup Poll: â€śOpen Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans.â€ť This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!
@realDonaldTrump	African Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia!
@realDonaldTrump	Senator Richard Burr, The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, just announced that after almost two years, more than two hundred interviews, and thousands of documents, they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this?

@realDonaldTrump	Disgraced FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe pretends to be a â€śpoor little Angelâ€ť when in fact he was a big part of the Crooked Hillary Scandal & the Russia Hoax - a puppet for Leakinâ€™ James Comey. I.G. report on McCabe was devastating. Part of â€śinsurance policyâ€ť in case I won....

@realDonaldTrump	....The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe, which is where they are expected to go. We do so much, and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States is asking Britain, France, Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them........

@realDonaldTrump	Wow, so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying, and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein, who was hired by Jeff Sessions (another beauty), look like they were planning a very illegal act, and got caught.....

@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to report that the U.S. has made substantial progress in our trade talks with China on important structural issues including intellectual property protection, technology transfer, agriculture, services, currency, and many other issues. As a result of these very......

@realDonaldTrump	President Xi of China has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with Kim Jong Un. The last thing China wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door. Sanctions placed on the border by China and Russia have been very helpful. Great relationship with Chairman Kim!
@realDonaldTrump	Very productive talks yesterday with China on Trade. Will continue today! I will be leaving for Hanoi, Vietnam, early tomorrow for a Summit with Kim Jong Un of North Korea, where we both expect a continuation of the progress made at first Summit in Singapore. Denuclearization?
@realDonaldTrump	HOLD THE DATE! We will be having one of the biggest gatherings in the history of Washington, D.C., on July 4th.

@realDonaldTrump	Michael Cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me (unfortunately). He had other clients also. He was just disbarred by the State Supreme Court for lying & fraud. He did bad things unrelated to Trump. He is lying in order to reduce his prison time. Using Crookedâ€™s lawyer!
@realDonaldTrump	I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal, the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats should stop talking about what I should do with North Korea and ask themselves instead why they didnâ€™t do â€śitâ€ť during eight years of the Obama Administration?
@realDonaldTrump	Vietnam is thriving like few places on earth. North Korea would be the same, and very quickly, if it would denuclearize. The potential is AWESOME, a great opportunity, like almost none other in history, for my friend Kim Jong Un. We will know fairly soon - Very Interesting!

@realDonaldTrump	....for Ottoâ€™s mistreatment and death. Most important, Otto Warmbier will not have died in vain. Otto and his family have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future. I love Otto and think of him often!
@realDonaldTrump	I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family. Remember, I got Otto out along with three others. The previous Administration did nothing, and he was taken on their watch. Of course I hold North Korea responsible....
@realDonaldTrump	Michael Cohenâ€™s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clintonâ€™s lawyer, Lanny Davis, say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?
@realDonaldTrump	...and the fraudulent and dishonest statements he made on Wednesday. No way, itâ€™s time to stop this corrupt and illegally brought Witch Hunt. Time to start looking at the other side where real crimes were committed. Republicans have been abused long enough. Must end now!
@realDonaldTrump	Ohâ€™ I see! Now that the 2 year Russian Collusion case has fallen apart, there was no Collusion except bye Crooked Hillary and the Democrats, they say, â€śgee, I have an idea, letâ€™s look at Trumpâ€™s finances and every deal he has ever done. Letâ€™s follow discredited Michael Cohen.....
@realDonaldTrump	Congress must demand the transcript of Michael Cohenâ€™s new book, given to publishers a short time ago. Your heads will spin when you see the lies, misrepresentations and contradictions  against his Thursday testimony. Like a different person! He is totally discredited!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow, just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a â€ślove letter to Trumpâ€ť manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki, his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony, which now is a lie!
@realDonaldTrump	Great to be back from Vietnam, an amazing place. We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong Un - we know what they want and they know what we must have. Relationship very good, letâ€™s see what happens!

@realDonaldTrump	The reason I do not want military drills with South Korea is to save hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. for which we are not reimbursed. That was my position long before I became President. Also, reducing tensions with North Korea at this time is a good thing!
@realDonaldTrump	My wonderful daughter, Ivanka, will be interviewed tonight by Steve Hilton on â€śThe Next Revolution.â€ť @FoxNews 9:00 P.M. She works so hard and has achieved so much for the U.S.A.(and gets so little credit!). Then watch Mark Levin at 10:00 P.M., a great show!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śLook how theyâ€™re acting now and how we act when weâ€™re in the majority. What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power. They couldnâ€™t find anything...they took a Fake Dossier & couldnâ€™t find any Collusion. Now they have a fake witness in Cohen.â€ť Congressman Mark Green, (R-TN).
@realDonaldTrump	After more than two years of Presidential Harassment, the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law. The hostile Cohen testimony, given by a liar to reduce his prison time, proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he.....
@realDonaldTrump	...said was a total lie, but Fake Media wonâ€™t show it. I am an innocent man being persecuted by some very bad, conflicted & corrupt people in a Witch Hunt that is illegal & should never have been allowed to start - And only because I won the Election! Despite this, great success!
@realDonaldTrump	Weâ€™ve got NASA â€śrockingâ€ť again. Great activity and success. Congrats to SPACEX and all!
@realDonaldTrump	The brand new manuscript for a new book by failed lawyer Michael Cohen shows his testimony was a total lie! Pundits should only use it.
@realDonaldTrump	Virtually everything failed lawyer Michael Cohen said in his sworn testimony last week is totally contradicted in his just released manuscript for a book about me. Itâ€™s a total new love letter to â€śTrumpâ€ť and the pols must now use it rather than his lies for sentence reduction!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThere is no Collusion. All of these investigations are in search of a crime. Democrats have no evidence to impeach President Trump. Ridiculous!â€ť @DevinNunes @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	â€śNow that the Dems are going to try & switch from Collusion to some other reason, it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didnâ€™t accept the WILL OF THE PEOPLE in the last election - they will do anything to get rid of the President.â€ť @AriFleischer It will never work!
@realDonaldTrump	The military drills, or war games as I call them, were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NKâ€”FAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those â€śgamesâ€ť, especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!
@realDonaldTrump	FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey, one of the best in our Country, has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).
@realDonaldTrump	To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims, and to the injured, God bless you all!

@realDonaldTrump	....a man who is considered by many to be the President with the most successful first two years in history, especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for â€śhigh crimes and misdemeanorsâ€ť?
@realDonaldTrump	I greatly appreciate Nancy Pelosiâ€™s statement against impeachment, but everyone must remember the minor fact that I never did anything wrong, the Economy and Unemployment are the best ever, Military and Vets are great - and many other successes! How do you impeach....
@realDonaldTrump	So many records being set with respect to our Economy. Unemployment numbers among BEST EVER. A beautiful thing to watch!

@realDonaldTrump	I look forward to VETOING the just passed Democrat inspired Resolution which would OPEN BORDERS while increasing Crime, Drugs, and Trafficking in our Country. I thank all of the Strong Republicans who voted to support Border Security and our desperately needed WALL!

@realDonaldTrump	A vote for todayâ€™s resolution by Republican Senators is a vote for Nancy Pelosi, Crime, and the Open Border Democrats!
@realDonaldTrump	....If, at a later date, Congress wants to update the law, I will support those efforts, but todayâ€™s issue is BORDER SECURITY and Crime!!! Donâ€™t vote with Pelosi!
@realDonaldTrump	Prominent legal scholars agree that our actions to address the National Emergency at the Southern Border and to protect the American people are both CONSTITUTIONAL and EXPRESSLY authorized by Congress....

@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are â€śBorder Deniers.â€ť They refuse to see or acknowledge the Death, Crime, Drugs and Human Trafficking at our Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	My Administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. The potential is unlimited!
@realDonaldTrump	A big National Emergency vote today by The United States Senate on Border Security & the Wall (which is already under major construction). I am prepared to veto, if necessary. The Southern Border is a National Security and Humanitarian Nightmare, but it can be easily fixed!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śDemocrats are frantic to throw something else at the President. Thatâ€™s why you saw those 81 subpoenas. Itâ€™s ridiculous. Just because your still upset over an election that happened 2 1/2 years ago, you should not be allowed to ruin peopleâ€™s lives like this.â€ť Lara Trump, @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke w/ @GovRicketts. The people of Nebraska & across the Midwest, especially the Farmers & Ranchers, are feeling the impacts from severe weather. The first responders & emergency response teams have done a great job dealing w/ record flooding, high winds, & road closures.
@realDonaldTrump	....that we stand in solidarity with New Zealand â€“ and that any assistance the U.S.A. can give, we stand by ready to help. We love you New Zealand!
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke with Jacinda Ardern, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, regarding the horrific events that have taken place over the past 24 hours. I informed the Prime Minister....
@realDonaldTrump	Iâ€™d like to thank all of the Great Republican Senators who bravely voted for Strong Border Security and the WALL. This will help stop Crime, Human Trafficking, and Drugs entering our Country. Watch, when you get back to your State, they will LOVE you more than ever before!
@realDonaldTrump	.....THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	....should never have been appointed and there should be no Mueller Report. This was an illegal & conflicted investigation in search of a crime. Russian Collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the Democrats for losing an Election that they thought they were going to win.....
@realDonaldTrump	So, if there was knowingly & acknowledged to be â€śzeroâ€ť crime when the Special Counsel was appointed, and if the appointment was made based on the Fake Dossier (paid for by Crooked Hillary) and now disgraced Andrew McCabe (he & all stated no crime), then the Special Counsel.......
@realDonaldTrump	â€śNew evidence that the Obama era team of the FBI, DOJ & CIA were working together to Spy on (and take out) President Trump, all the way back in 2015.â€ť A transcript of Peter Strzokâ€™s testimony is devastating. Hopefully the Mueller Report will be covering this. @OANN @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	The â€Jexodusâ€™ movement encourages Jewish people to leave the Democrat Party. Total disrespect! Republicans are waiting with open arms. Remember Jerusalem (U.S. Embassy) and the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal! @OANN @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died, with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!
@realDonaldTrump	How is the Paris Environmental Accord working out for France? After 18 weeks of rioting by the Yellow Vest Protesters, I guess not so well! In the meantime, the United States has gone to the top of all lists on the Environment.
@realDonaldTrump	Google is helping China and their military, but not the U.S. Terrible! The good news is that they helped Crooked Hillary Clinton, and not Trump....and how did that turn out?
@realDonaldTrump	Because the economy is so good, General Motors must get their Lordstown, Ohio, plant open, maybe in a different form or with a new owner, FAST! Toyota is investing 13.5 $Billion in U.S., others likewise. G.M. MUST ACT QUICKLY. Time is of the essence!
@realDonaldTrump	Spreading the fake and totally discredited Dossier â€śis unfortunately a very dark stain against John McCain.â€ť Ken Starr, Former Independent Counsel.

@realDonaldTrump	On the recent non-binding vote (420-0) in Congress about releasing the Mueller Report, I told leadership to let all Republicans vote for transparency. Makes us all look good and doesnâ€™t matter. Play along with the game!
@realDonaldTrump	What the Democrats have done in trying to steal a Presidential Election, first at the â€śballot boxâ€ť and then, after that failed, with the â€śInsurance Policy,â€ť is the biggest Scandal in the history of our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to Mary Barra, CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant. I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING. I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union â€” I donâ€™t care, I just want it open!
@realDonaldTrump	Those Republican Senators who voted in favor of Strong Border Security (and the Wall) are being uniformly praised as they return to their States. They know there is a National Emergency at the Southern Border, and they had the courage to ACT. Great job!
@realDonaldTrump	Were @FoxNews weekend anchors, @ArthelNeville and @LelandVittert, trained by CNN prior to their ratings collapse? In any event, thatâ€™s where they should be working, along with their lowest rated anchor, Shepard Smith!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce. G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done! 3.8% Unemployment!
@realDonaldTrump	....to the people that got you there. Keep fighting for Tucker, and fight hard for @JudgeJeanine. Your competitors are jealous - they all want what youâ€™ve got - NUMBER ONE. Donâ€™t hand it to them on a silver platter. They canâ€™t beat you, you can only beat yourselves!
@realDonaldTrump	....must stay strong and fight back with vigor. Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct, which will only bring you down, and continue to fight for our Country. The losers all want what you have, donâ€™t give it to them. Be strong & prosper, be weak & die! Stay true....

He & the Dems, working together, failed (as usual). Even the Fake News refused this garbage!
@realDonaldTrump	Report: Christopher Steele backed up his Democrat & Crooked Hillary paid for Fake & Unverified Dossier with information he got from â€śsend in watchersâ€ť of low ratings CNN. This is the info that got us the Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	....Should Federal Election Commission and/or FCC look into this? There must be Collusion with the Democrats and, of course, Russia! Such one sided media coverage, most of it Fake News. Hard to believe I won and am winning. Approval Rating 52%, 93% with Republicans. Sorry!  #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump	General Motors and the UAW are going to start â€śtalksâ€ť in September/October. Why wait, start them now!

@realDonaldTrump	Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier & different than campaigning for the Electoral College. Itâ€™s like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote, you go to....

@realDonaldTrump	So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So, they were either duped or corrupt? In any event, their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!
@realDonaldTrump	...The problem is, no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get, no matter what we give them, it will never be enough. Just watch, they will Harass & Complain & Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO, weâ€™ve got a Country to run!
@realDonaldTrump	Robert Mueller was a Hero to the Radical Left Democrats, until he ruled that there was No Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous to even say!). After more than two years since the â€śinsurance policyâ€ť statement was made by a dirty cop, I got the answers I wanted, the Truth.....
@realDonaldTrump	Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates, especially since there is very little inflation, and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening, the 3.0% GDP, & Stock Market, would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!
@realDonaldTrump	....the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and â€śtalk.â€ť Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing!
@realDonaldTrump	....through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs. If Mexico doesnâ€™t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States throug our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING.....
@realDonaldTrump	The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest, & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore, CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW, & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S....

@realDonaldTrump	â€śOutrageous, itâ€™s the Adam Schiff problem. People abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that didnâ€™t prove to be true. You look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival. Who made it?â€ť James Freeman, @WSJ
@realDonaldTrump	Everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the No Collusion, No Obstruction Trump Campaign began. We need to know for future generations to understand. This Hoax should never be allowed to happen to another President or Administration again!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats should stop fighting Sen. David Perdueâ€™s disaster relief bill. They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!
@realDonaldTrump	No matter what information is given to the crazed Democrats from the No Collusion Mueller Report, it will never be good enough. Behind closed doors the Dems are laughing!
@realDonaldTrump	The cost of ObamaCare is far too high for our great citizens. The deductibles, in many cases way over $7000, make it almost worthless or unusable. Good things are going to happen! @SenRickScott @senatemajldr @SenJohnBarrasso @SenBillCassidy
@realDonaldTrump	Can you believe that the Radical Left Democrats want to do our new and very important Census Report without the all important Citizenship Question. Report would be meaningless and a waste of the $Billions (ridiculous) that it costs to put together!
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats, working with Republicans in Congress, can fix the Asylum and other loopholes quickly. We have a major National Emergency at our Border. GET IT DONE NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	"Now that the long awaited Mueller Report conclusions have been released, most Democrats and others have gone back to the pre-Witch Hunt phase of their lives before Collusion Delusion took over. Others are pretending that their former hero, Bob Mueller, no longer exists!"

@realDonaldTrump	There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Robert Mueller was a God-like figure to the Democrats, until he ruled No Collusion in the long awaited $30,000,000 Mueller Report. Now the Dems donâ€™t even acknowledge his name, have become totally unhinged, and would like to go through the whole process again. It wonâ€™t happen!

@realDonaldTrump	....The best thing that ever happened to Puerto Rico is President Donald J. Trump. So many wonderful people, but with such bad Island leadership and with so much money wasted. Cannot continue to hurt our Farmers and States with these massive payments, and so little appreciation!
@realDonaldTrump	Puerto Rico got 91 Billion Dollars for the hurricane, more money than has ever been gotten for a hurricane before, & all their local politicians do is complain & ask for more money. The pols are grossly incompetent, spend the money foolishly or corruptly, & only take from USA....
@realDonaldTrump	....the crazed and incompetent Mayor of San Juan have done such a poor job  of bringing the Island back to health. 91 Billion Dollars to Puerto Rico, and now the Dems want to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful!
@realDonaldTrump	....are GREAT, but the politicians are incompetent or corrupt. Puerto Rico got far more money than Texas & Florida combined, yet their government canâ€™t do anything right, the place is a mess - nothing works.

@realDonaldTrump	....are developing a really great HealthCare Plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than ObamaCare. In other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than ObamaCare. Vote will be taken right after the Election when Republicans hold the Senate & win......
@realDonaldTrump	Everybody agrees that ObamaCare doesnâ€™t work. Premiums & deductibles are far too high - Really bad HealthCare! Even the Dems want to replace it, but with Medicare for all, which would cause 180 million Americans to lose their beloved private health insurance. The Republicans.....

@realDonaldTrump	The New York Times had no legitimate sources, which would be totally illegal, concerning the Mueller Report. In fact, they probably had no sources at all! They are a Fake News paper who have already been forced to apologize for their incorrect and very bad reporting on me!
@realDonaldTrump	There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy. This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	According to polling, few people seem to care about the Russian Collusion Hoax, but some Democrats are fighting hard to keep the Witch Hunt alive. They should focus on legislation or, even better, an investigation of how the ridiculous Collusion Delusion got started - so illegal!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite the unnecessary and destructive actions taken by the Fed, the Economy is looking very strong, the China and USMCA deals are moving along nicely, there is little or no Inflation, and USA optimism is very high!

@realDonaldTrump	....However, if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from, the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesnâ€™t work, which it will, I will close the Border.......
@realDonaldTrump	The Crazed and Dishonest Washington Post again purposely got it wrong. Mexico, for the first time in decades, is meaningfully apprehending illegals at THEIR Southern Border, before the long march up to the U.S. This is great and the way it should be. The big flow will stop.......

@realDonaldTrump	....In the meantime, the Democrats in Congress must help the Republicans (we need their votes) to end the horrible, costly and foolish loopholes in our Immigration Laws. Once that happens, all will be smooth. We can NEVER allow Open Borders!
@realDonaldTrump	....itâ€™s powerful common sense Immigration Laws to stop illegals from coming through Mexico into the U.S., and removing them back to their country of origin. Until Mexico cleans up this ridiculous & massive migration, we will be focusing on Border Security, not Ports of Entry....
@realDonaldTrump	We have redeployed 750 agents at the Southern Borderâ€™s specific Ports of Entry in order to help with the large scale surge of illegal migrants trying to make their way into the United States.

@realDonaldTrump	Mueller, and the A.G. based on Mueller findings (and great intelligence), have already ruled No Collusion, No Obstruction. These were crimes committed by Crooked Hillary, the DNC, Dirty Cops and others! INVESTIGATE THE INVESTIGATORS!

@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the Mueller Report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was NO COLLUSION WITH RUSSIA. The Russia Hoax is dead!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite the fact that the Mueller Report should not have been authorized in the first place & was written as nastily as possible by 13 (18) Angry Democrats who were true Trump Haters, including highly conflicted Bob Mueller himself, the end result is No Collusion, No Obstruction!
@realDonaldTrump	How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Can you believe that I had to go through the worst and most corrupt political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States (No Collusion) when it was the â€śother sideâ€ť that illegally created the diversionary & criminal event and even spied on my campaign? Disgraceful!
@realDonaldTrump	Jobless claims in the United States have reached their lowest (BEST) level in over 50 years!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite No Collusion, No Obstruction, The Radical Left Democrats do not want to go on to Legislate for the good of the people, but only to Investigate and waste time. This is costing our Country greatly, and will cost the Dems big time in 2020!

@realDonaldTrump	The NRA is under siege by Cuomo and the New York State A.G., who are illegally using the Stateâ€™s legal apparatus to take down and destroy this very important organization, & others. It must get its act together quickly, stop the internal fighting, & get back to GREATNESS - FAST!

@realDonaldTrump	NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION. Besides, how can you have Obstruction when not only was there No Collusion (by Trump), but the bad actions were done by the â€śotherâ€ť side? The greatest con-job in the history of American Politics!
@realDonaldTrump	Why didnâ€™t President Obama do something about Russia in September (before November Election) when told by the FBI? He did NOTHING, and had no intention of doing anything!

@realDonaldTrump	Very good call yesterday with President Putin of Russia. Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia, despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media. Look how they have misled you on â€śRussia Collusion.â€ť The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!
@realDonaldTrump	Anything in this very interesting world is possible, but I believe that Kim Jong Un fully realizes the great economic potential of North Korea, & will do nothing to interfere or end it. He also knows that I am with him & does not want to break his promise to me. Deal will happen!
@realDonaldTrump	When will the Radical Left Wing Media apologize to me for knowingly getting the Russia Collusion Delusion story so wrong? The real story is about to happen! Why is @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN, @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter & Facebook. Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!
@realDonaldTrump	There is nothing easy about a USA Infrastructure Plan, especially when our great Country has spent an astounding 7 trillion dollars in the Middle East over the last 19 years, but I am looking hard at a bipartisan plan of 1 to 2 trillion dollars. Badly needed!

@realDonaldTrump	For 10 months, China has been paying Tariffs to the USA of 25% on 50 Billion Dollars of High Tech, and 10% on 200 Billion Dollars of other goods. These payments are partially responsible for our great economic results. The 10% will go up to 25% on Friday. 325 Billions Dollars....

@realDonaldTrump	The reason for the China pullback & attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to â€śnegotiateâ€ť with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats, and thereby continue to ripoff the United States (($500 Billion a year)) for years to come....

@realDonaldTrump	Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS!
@realDonaldTrump	....If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers, far more than China buys now, we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure, Healthcare, or anything else. China would greatly slow down, and we would automatically speed up!
@realDonaldTrump	The average 401(k) balance has SOARED since the bottom of the market - 466%. Wow!
@realDonaldTrump	Tariffs will make our Country MUCH STRONGER, not weaker. Just sit back and watch! In the meantime, China should not renegotiate deals with the U.S. at the last minute. This is not the Obama Administration, or the Administration of Sleepy Joe, who let China get away with â€śmurder!â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also, much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better, faster, and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted, or go to new source!
@realDonaldTrump	....agricultural products from our Great Farmers, in larger amounts than China ever did, and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance. In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!
@realDonaldTrump	....The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars. The U.S. only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods & products, a very big imbalance. With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in, we will buy.....
@realDonaldTrump	Talks with China continue in a very congenial manner - there is absolutely no need to rush - as Tariffs are NOW being paid to the United States by China of 25% on 250 Billion Dollars worth of goods & products. These massive payments go directly to the Treasury of the U.S....

@realDonaldTrump	I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!
@realDonaldTrump	....The only problem is that they know I am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in U.S. history, & much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!
@realDonaldTrump	I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky & have a Democrat win - in which case they would continue to rip-off the USA for $500 Billion a year....
@realDonaldTrump	So now the Radical Left Dems donâ€™t talk about Collusion anymore, because the Mueller Report said there was No Collusion, they only want to talk about Obstruction, even though there was No Obstruction or No Crime - except for the crimes committed by the other side!
@realDonaldTrump	I won the 2016 Election partially based on no Tax Returns while I am under audit (which I still am), and the voters didnâ€™t care. Now the Radical Left Democrats want to again relitigate this matter. Make it a part of the 2020 Election!
@realDonaldTrump	Such an easy way to avoid Tariffs? Make or produce your goods and products in the good old USA. Itâ€™s very simple!
@realDonaldTrump	China is DREAMING that Sleepy Joe Biden, or any of the others, gets elected in 2020. They LOVE ripping off America!
@realDonaldTrump	The â€śConstitutional Crisisâ€ť is the Democrats refusing to work. Let them start by fixing the mess that their Immigration Laws have caused at the Southern Border.
@realDonaldTrump	When the Mueller Report came out showing NO Collusion with Russia (of course), it was supposed to be over, back to work for the people. But the Dems have gone â€śnuts,â€ť and it has actually gotten worse! Hope the Republicans win back the House in 2020, or little will get done!
@realDonaldTrump	Ever since the Mueller Report showed No Collusion & No Obstruction, the Dems have been working overtime to damage me and the Republican Party by issuing over 80 demands for documents and testimonies, and with NO REASON. Thatâ€™s all they want to do - donâ€™t care about anything else!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite two years and millions of dollars spent, the Democrats are acting like crazed lunatics ever since the results of the Mueller Report were made public. But they knew there was NOTHING even before the Report was started. It is all a big Hoax, the biggest in American history!
@realDonaldTrump	....employment numbers ever, low taxes & regulations, a rebuilt military & V.A., many great new judges, & so much more. But we have had a giant SCAM perpetrated upon our nation, a Witch Hunt, a Treasonous Hoax. That is the Constitutional Crisis & hopefully guilty people will pay!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats new and pathetically untrue sound bite is that we are in a â€śConstitutional Crisis.â€ť They and their partner, the Fake News Media, are all told to say this as loud and as often as possible. They are a sad JOKE! We may have the strongest Economy in our history, best...
@realDonaldTrump	....We will then spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture), which is a small percentage of total Tariffs received, and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! GREAT! #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	We are right where we want to be with China. Remember, they broke the deal with us & tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal), or buy it from non-Tariffed countries...
@realDonaldTrump	Really sad! https://twitter.com/johncardillo/status/1127561555204349952Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Big attacks on Republicans and Conservatives by Social Media. Not good!
@realDonaldTrump	....Hoax. My campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the Democrats. This never happened before in American history, and it all turned out to be a total scam, a Witch Hunt, that yielded No Collusion, No Obstruction. This must never be allowed to happen again!
@realDonaldTrump	Think of it. I became President of the United States in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation. From long before I ever took office, I was under a sick & unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the Russian....

@realDonaldTrump	I met Marine Sgt. John Peck, a quadruple amputee who has received a double arm transplant, at Walter Reed in 2017. Today, it was my honor to welcome John (HERO) to the Oval, with his wonderful wife Jessica. He also wrote a book that I highly recommend, â€śRebuilding Sergeant Peck.â€ť pic.twitter.com/eiNnHcEU7x
@realDonaldTrump	Wishing former President Jimmy Carter a speedy recovery from his hip surgery earlier today. He was in such good spirits when we spoke last month - he will be fine!
@realDonaldTrump	Great to welcome Chairman Shin from Lotte Group to the WH. They just invested $3.1 BILLION into Louisiana-biggest investment in U.S. EVER from a South Korean company, & thousands more jobs for Americans. Great partners like ROK know the U.S. economy is running stronger than ever! pic.twitter.com/WaJxDeTuxj
@realDonaldTrump	Today, I officially updated my budget to include $18 million for our GREAT @SpecialOlympics, whose athletes inspire us and make our Nation so PROUD!
@realDonaldTrump	We must protect our Great Lakes, keeping them clean and beautiful for future generations. Thatâ€™s why I am fighting for $300 million in my updated budget for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative.
@realDonaldTrump	Under my Administration, we are restoring @NASA to greatness and we are going back to the Moon, then Mars. I am updating my budget to include an additional $1.6 billion so that we can return to Space in a BIG WAY!
@realDonaldTrump	My Administration will be fighting for $200 million for the Army Corps Everglades restoration work this year. Congress needs to help us complete the worldâ€™s largest intergovernmental watershed restoration project ASAP! Good for Florida and good for the environment.
@realDonaldTrump	..There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China, very good for USA! But China has taken so advantage of the U.S. for so many years, that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore, China should not retaliate-will only get worse!
@realDonaldTrump	...completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country, or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). Thatâ€™s Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. Thatâ€™s why China wants to make a deal so badly!...
@realDonaldTrump	There is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs, which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S., 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also, the Tariffs can be.....
@realDonaldTrump	Democrat Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust. She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people. Can you imagine what would happen if I ever said what she said, and says?

@realDonaldTrump	Has anyone noticed that all the Boston @RedSox have done is WIN since coming to the White House! Others also have done very well. The White House visit is becoming the opposite of being on the cover of Sports Illustrated! By the way, the Boston players were GREAT guys!
@realDonaldTrump	The unexpectedly good first quarter 3.2% GDP was greatly helped by Tariffs from China. Some people just donâ€™t get it!
@realDonaldTrump	Also, congratulations to @OANN on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump (â€śthank you President Trumpâ€ť)!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @foxandfriends, great show this morning and congratulations on your number one (by far) rating. Well deserved!
@realDonaldTrump	I say openly to President Xi & all of my many friends in China that China will be hurt very badly if you donâ€™t make a deal because companies will be forced to leave China for other countries. Too expensive to buy in China. You had a great deal, almost completed, & you backed out!

As long as President Trump is President, his opposition will use every tool, and misuse every tool available, to make his life miserable.â€ť @TomFitton @JudicialWatch @LouDobbs  Sadly, this proves I am doing a great job - Also, Best Economy and Employment Numbers EVER!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śItâ€™s the attack strategy of harass. This is not about the Attorney General, who is very sophisticated & knows it isnâ€™t about him, itâ€™s about trying to destroy President Trump through an assault on his AG for upholding the rule of law. He released a massive amount of......

@realDonaldTrump	....and the Democrat National Committee-The Democrat Party apparatus-has been caught using donor Dollars to Collude with Russian Intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent (me). The FBI has no leadership. The Director is protecting the same gang.....that tried to....
@realDonaldTrump	â€śJust another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the Democrats that began during the Obama Administration, continued through the Mueller FBI operation, & now the baton has been passed to Jerry Nadler to continue to abuse power to harass President Trump..

@realDonaldTrump	China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates, as always, in order to make up for the business they are, and will be, losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a â€śmatch,â€ť it would be game over, we win! In any event, China wants a deal!
@realDonaldTrump	....This money will come from the massive Tariffs being paid to the United States for allowing China, and others, to do business with us. The Farmers have been â€śforgottenâ€ť for many years. Their time is now!
@realDonaldTrump	Our great Patriot Farmers will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of what is happening now. Hopefully China will do us the honor of continuing to buy our great farm product, the best, but if not your Country will be making up the difference based on a very high China buy......
@realDonaldTrump	....of the tremendous ground we have lost to China on Trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the WTO. It will all happen, and much faster than people think!
@realDonaldTrump	When the time is right we will make a deal with China.

We have to be allowed to make up some.....
@realDonaldTrump	Billions of Dollars, and moving jobs back to the USA where they belong. Other countries are already negotiating with us because they donâ€™t want this to happen to them. They must be a part of USA action. This should have been done by our leaders many years ago. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	We can make a deal with China tomorrow, before their companies start leaving so as not to lose USA business, but the last time we were close they wanted to renegotiate the deal. No way! We are in a much better position now than any deal we could have made. Will be taking in.....
@realDonaldTrump	....so that they will be more competitive for USA buyers. We are now a much bigger economy than China, and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election. We are the â€śpiggy bankâ€ť that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of. NO MORE!
@realDonaldTrump	China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them, by almost 500 Billion Dollars, so we are in a fantastic position. Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff. You can also buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China. Many companies are leaving China.....
@realDonaldTrump	In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming! We placed a 25% Tariff on â€śdumpedâ€ť steel from China & other countries, and we now have a big and growing industry.

@realDonaldTrump	....But they really want a do-over! You canâ€™t investigate and legislate simultaneously - it just doesnâ€™t work that way. You canâ€™t go down two tracks at the same time. Let Chuck, Nancy, Jerry, Adam and all of the rest finish playing their games....
@realDonaldTrump	So sad that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our Country. They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40M and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America, or get back to work....
@realDonaldTrump	As I have long been saying, and has now been proven out, this is a Witch Hunt against the Republican Party and myself, and it was the other side that caused the problem, not us!
@realDonaldTrump	"..BETWEEN RUSSIA AND THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN. Mr. McGahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in Mr. Nadlerâ€™s pseudo-impeachment drama.â€ť Wall Street Journal Editorial Board Today - May 21, 2019"
@realDonaldTrump	â€śHe (Jerry Nadler) wants a show. He wants to use Mr. McGahn as a prop to spend three hours claiming that Mr. Trump tried to obstruct the Mueller investigation. YET MR. MUELLER WASNâ€™T OBSTRUCTED IN ANY WAY, HIS COPIOUS REPORT WAS RELEASED FOR ALL TO SEE, & THERE WAS NO COLLUSION..
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe Democrats are in danger of becoming irrelevant because of their decision to keep taking the country on wild goose chases. They ought to start governing. You know, for a change.â€ť  Michael Goodwin @newyorkpost
@realDonaldTrump	Everybody, including me, thought that when the 40 Million Dollar Mueller Report was released with No Collusion and No Obstruction (of a crime caused by others), that was the end. But no, the Democrats want to keep it going in an effort to help them in 2020. Bad for the Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Also, tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing Walls that are in bad condition and ineffective, and bringing them to a very high standard!
@realDonaldTrump	Much of the Wall being built at the Southern Border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new Wall and footings. Problem is, the Haters say that is not a new Wall, but rather a renovation. Wrong, and we must build where most needed....
@realDonaldTrump	Without the ILLEGAL Witch Hunt, my poll numbers, especially because of our historically â€śgreatâ€ť economy, would be at 65%. Too bad! The greatest Hoax in American History.
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are getting ZERO work done in Congress. All they are focused on is trying to prove the Mueller Report wrong, the Witch Hunt!
@realDonaldTrump	After two years of an expensive and comprehensive Witch Hunt, the Democrats donâ€™t like the result and they want a DO OVER. In other words, the Witch Hunt continues!
@realDonaldTrump	Everything the Democrats are asking me for is based on an illegally started investigation that failed for them, especially when the Mueller Report came back with a NO COLLUSION finding. Now they say Impeach President Trump, even though he did nothin wrong, while they â€śfish!â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Governor @MattBevin on winning the Republican Primary for Governor tonight in the Great State of KENTUCKY. Matt, you are doing a fantastic job!
@realDonaldTrump	Great news for Republicans: Fred Keller has just won the hard fought for Pennsylvania Congressional contest in a LANDSLIDE, over 70% of the vote. Thanks to the thousands who showed up for the Rally last night. Congratulations to Fred and his wonderful family!
@realDonaldTrump	John Brennan on the Mueller probe, â€śI donâ€™t know if I received bad information, but I THINK I SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN THERE ACTUALLY WAS.â€ť Wow, he admits he was wrong! Congress should go back to work on drug prices etc.
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are on a fishing expedition, wanting to interview the same people, and see the same things, as we just went through for two years with Robert Mueller and the 18 Angry Dems. Never happened to a president before. Never even happened to President Obama!
@realDonaldTrump	After spending 40 Million Dollars, reviewing 1.4 million pages of documents, & interviewing 500 people with the total support of the White House, the Mueller Report was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT to the Democrats, so they want a DO OVER. It doesnâ€™t work that way-so bad for our Country!

@realDonaldTrump	When the Democrats in Congress refinish, for the 5th time, their Fake work on their very disappointing Mueller Report finding, they will have the time to get the REAL work of the people done. Move quickly!
@realDonaldTrump	I was extremely calm yesterday with my meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, knowing that they would say I was raging, which they always do, along with their partner, the Fake News Media. Well, so many stories about the meeting use the Rage narrative anyway - Fake & Corrupt Press!
@realDonaldTrump	Rex Tillerson, a man who is â€śdumb as a rockâ€ť and totally ill prepared and ill equipped to be Secretary of State, made up a story (he got fired) that I was out-prepared by Vladimir Putin at a meeting in Hamburg, Germany. I donâ€™t think Putin would agree. Look how the U.S. is doing!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats have become known as THE DO NOTHING PARTY!
@realDonaldTrump	....drug prices, pre-existing conditions and our great Vets. All they are geared up to do, six committees, is squander time, day after day, trying to find anything which will be bad for me. A pure fishing expedition like this never happened before, & it should never happen again!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats are getting nothing done in Congress. All of their effort is about a Re-Do of the Mueller Report, which didnâ€™t turn out the way they wanted. It is not possible for them to investigate and legislate at the same time. Their heart is not into Infrastructure, lower.....
@realDonaldTrump	Democrats donâ€™t want to fix the loopholes at the Border. They donâ€™t want to do anything. Open Borders and crime!
@realDonaldTrump	Zero is getting done with the Democrats in charge of the House. All they want to do is put the Mueller Report behind them and start all over again. No Do-Overs!
@realDonaldTrump	In a letter to her House colleagues, Nancy Pelosi said: â€śPresident Trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see.â€ť This is not true. I was purposely very polite and calm, much as I was minutes later with the press in the Rose Garden. Can be easily proven. It is all such a lie!
@realDonaldTrump	.....The Dems want a second shot at Bob Mueller, are very unhappy with the No Collusion Report. They should not be allowed to play this game any longer - no second chances - must get back to work. So bad for our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	....(with many more to come) and 2 Supreme Court Justices - we are getting into record territory! Thank you all and have a great Memorial Day Weekend.
@realDonaldTrump	Mitch McConnell and our Republican Senators have been very solid and strong. We have accomplished a great deal together, in particular with our Courts, 107 Federal Judges....
@realDonaldTrump	Departed the @WhiteHouse and am now on Air Force One with the First Lady heading to Japan and looking forward to honoring, on behalf of the United States, His Majesty, the Emperor of Japan.

I was at @ArlingtonNatl yesterday & the people there were so grateful for Tomâ€™s inspiring portrait of â€śThe Old Guard.â€ť Great job @TomCottonAR!
@realDonaldTrump	I donâ€™t know why the Radical Left Democrats want Bob Mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 Million Dollar Report that states, loud & clear & for all to hear, No Collusion and No Obstruction (how do you Obstruct a NO crime?) Dems are just looking for trouble and a Do-Over!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIf they try to Impeach President Trump, who has done nothing wrong (No Collusion), they will end up getting him re-electedâ€ť @LindseyGrahamSC Impeachment is for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. There were no High Crimes and Misdemeanors, except for those committed by the other side!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIntelligence Agencies were used against an American President.â€ť @DevinNunes @ShannonBream @FoxNews  This should NEVER happen to a President again! Dems are furious at Robert Mueller for his findings - NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION. Now they should go back to work and legislate!
@realDonaldTrump	When is Twitter going to allow the very popular Conservative Voices that it has so viciously shut down, back into the OPEN? IT IS TIME!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! CNN Ratings are WAY DOWN, record lows. People are getting tired of so many Fake Stories and Anti-Trump lies. Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot - which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon!

@realDonaldTrump	@FoxNews Poll: A majority of Americans want the Democrats to stop investigating President Trump. The Mueller Report said very strongly NO COLLUSION, which led to NO OBSTRUCTION. The Dems canâ€™t get over 2016 or the conclusive Mueller findings. They are now the Do Nothing Party!

@realDonaldTrump	I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT, they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN, which is dying in the ratings anyway.

@realDonaldTrump	Just arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that @CNN is the primary source of news available from the U.S. After watching it for a short while, I turned it off. All negative & so much Fake News, very bad for U.S. Big ratings drop. Why doesnâ€™t owner @ATT do something?
@realDonaldTrump	China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries, including the United States, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking Billions!

@realDonaldTrump	If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, & there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm & Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately. If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!

@realDonaldTrump	I would like to thank the President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, and his foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, together with all of the many representatives of both the United States and Mexico, for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed!
@realDonaldTrump	Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico!
@realDonaldTrump	Nervous Nancy Pelosi & the Democrat House are getting nothing done. Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA, the spectacular & very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA, the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers, Manufacturers & Unions!

@realDonaldTrump	For two years all the Democrats talked about was the Mueller Report, because they knew that it was loaded up with 13 Angry Democrat Trump Haters, later increased to 18. But despite the bias, when the Report came out, the findings were No Collusion and facts that led to........

@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe latest Polls find 51% of Americans approve of President Trumpâ€™s Job Performance. Last month a Democrat Pollster said President Trumpâ€™s approval rating has been the most steady of any President in history!â€ť @OANN
@realDonaldTrump	Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. â€śI think we have a very real risk of losing the Presidency to Donald Trump.â€ť I agree, and that is the only reason they play the impeach card, which cannot be legally used!
@realDonaldTrump	Almost 70% in new Poll say donâ€™t impeach. So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side. They canâ€™t win the election fairly!

@realDonaldTrump	A poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper, the Failing New York Times or the Amazon (lobbyist) Washington Post! They are both a disgrace to our Country, the Enemy of the People, but I just canâ€™t seem to figure out which is worse? The good.....

@realDonaldTrump	The story in the @nytimes about the U.S. escalating attacks on Russiaâ€™s power grid is Fake News, and the Failing New York Times knows it. They should immediately release their sources which, if they exist at all, which I doubt, are phony. Times must be held fully accountable!

@realDonaldTrump	Thatâ€™s right, The Trump Foundation gave away 100% plus, with Zero rent or expenses charged, and has been being sued by Cuomo and New York State for years - another part of the political Witch Hunt. Just in case anyone is interested - Clinton Foundation never even looked at!

@realDonaldTrump	Robert Mueller is being asked to testify yet again. He said he could only stick to the Report, & that is what he would and must do. After so much testimony & total transparency, this Witch Hunt must now end. No more Do Overs. No Collusion, No Obstruction. The Great Hoax is dead!

@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher, his wonderful wife Andrea, and his entire family. You have been through much together. Glad I could help!
@realDonaldTrump	The cost of our great Salute to America tomorrow will be very little compared to what it is worth. We own the planes, we have the pilots, the airport is right next door (Andrews), all we need is the fuel. We own the tanks and all. Fireworks are donated by two of the greats. Nice!
@realDonaldTrump	China and Europe playing big currency manipulation game and pumping money into their system in order to compete with USA. We should MATCH, or continue being the dummies who sit back and politely watch as other countries continue to play their games - as they have for many years!

@realDonaldTrump	I am pleased to announce that a deal has been struck with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - on a two-year Budget and Debt Ceiling, with no poison pills....
@realDonaldTrump	The â€śSquadâ€ť is a very Racist group of troublemakers who are young, inexperienced, and not very smart. They are pulling the once great Democrat Party far left, and were against humanitarian aid at the Border...And are now against ICE and Homeland Security. So bad for our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	Going with First Lady to pay our respects to Justice Stevens. Leaving now!
@realDonaldTrump	The Report of Iran capturing CIA spies is totally false. Zero truth. Just more lies and propaganda (like their shot down drone) put out by a Religious Regime that is Badly Failing and has no idea what to do. Their Economy is dead, and will get much worse. Iran is a total mess!
@realDonaldTrump	....But the questions should be asked, why were all of Clintonâ€™s people given immunity, and why were the text messages of Peter S and his lover, Lisa Page, deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller, and after we requested them(this is Illegal)?
@realDonaldTrump	Highly conflicted Robert Mueller should not be given another bite at the apple. In the end it will be bad for him and the phony Democrats in Congress who have done nothing but waste time on this ridiculous Witch Hunt. Result of the Mueller Report, NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!...
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mainstream Media is out of control. They constantly lie and cheat in order to get their Radical Left Democrat views out their for all to see. It has never been this bad. They have gone bonkers, & no longer care what is right or wrong. This large scale false reporting is sick!
@realDonaldTrump	....except for those stated by me, & â€śreams of paperâ€ť were never given to me. It is a made up story meant to demean & belittle. The Post had no sources. The facts remain the same, that we have 4 Radical Left Congresswomen who have said very bad things about Israel & our Country!
@realDonaldTrump	The Amazon Washington Post front page story yesterday was total Fake News. They said â€śAdvisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen.â€ť Now really, does that sound like me? What advisors, there were no talking points,....
@realDonaldTrump	It is far more costly for the Federal Reserve to cut deeper if the economy actually does, in the future, turn down! Very inexpensive, in fact productive,  to move now. The Fed raised & tightened far too much & too fast. In other words, they missed it (Big!). Donâ€™t miss it again!
@realDonaldTrump	....as we have done, it could have been soooo much better. Interest rate costs should have been much lower, & GDP & our Countryâ€™s wealth accumulation much higher. Such a waste of time & money. Also, very unfair that other countries manipulate their currencies and pump money in!
@realDonaldTrump	With almost no inflation, our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve. In addition, Quantitative Tightening is continuing, making it harder for our Country to compete. As good.....
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you very much for revealing the incredible facts, which the Fake News Media will never do! @SteveHiltonx @NextRevFNC pic.twitter.com/SgRnbsh5pT
@realDonaldTrump	....Based on the comments made by Senator Schumer, he must have seen how dangerous & bad for our Country the Border is. It is not a â€śmanufactured crisis,â€ť as the Fake News Media & their Democrat partners tried to portray. He said he wants to meet. I will set up a meeting ASAP!
@realDonaldTrump	Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing! Nearby, he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally. They wildly  rushed Border Patrol. Some Agents were badly injured....

@realDonaldTrump	Budget Deal gives great victories to our Military and Vets, keeps out Democrat poison pill riders. Republicans and Democrats in Congress need to act ASAP and support this deal.
@realDonaldTrump	....I got to know him over his many years as Chairman of the Police Athletic League, for which he devoted so much time and energy. Bob Morgenthau, a legend, will be greatly missed!
@realDonaldTrump	I was saddened to learn of the recent passing of Bob Morgenthau, a truly great man! Bob served as a Naval Officer in World War II, was an extraordinary US Attorney, Manhattan District Attorney, and always a warrior for our Country that he loved so dearly....
@realDonaldTrump	Leaving for Turning Point USA. Will be speaking to some of the greatest and smartest young people on the planet. See you there!
@realDonaldTrump	When an old Wall at the Southern Border, that is crumbling and falling over, built in an important section to keep out problems, is replaced with a brand new 30 foot high steel and concrete Wall, the Media says no new Wall has been built. Fake News! Building lots of Wall!
@realDonaldTrump	In 2016 I almost won Minnesota. In 2020, because of America hating anti-Semite Rep.

@realDonaldTrump	NO COLLUSION, NO OBSTRUCTION!
@realDonaldTrump	So why didnâ€™t the highly conflicted Robert Mueller investigate how and why Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted and acid washed 33,000 Emails immediately AFTER getting a SUBPOENA from the United States Congress? She must have GREAT lawyers!
@realDonaldTrump	Why didnâ€™t Robert Mueller & his band of 18 Angry Democrats spend any time investigating Crooked Hillary Clinton, Lyinâ€™ & Leakinâ€™ James Comey, Lisa Page and her Psycho lover, Peter S, Andy McCabe, the beautiful Ohr family, Fusion GPS, and many more,  including HIMSELF & Andrew W?
@realDonaldTrump	It was NEVER agreed that Robert Mueller could use one of his many Democrat Never Trumper lawyers to sit next to him and help him with his answers. This was specifically NOT agreed to, and I would NEVER have agreed to it. The Greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. history, by far!
@realDonaldTrump	So Democrats and others can illegally fabricate a crime, try pinning it on a very innocent President, and when he fights back against this illegal and treasonous attack on our Country, they call It Obstruction? Wrong! Why didnâ€™t Robert Mueller investigate the investigators?
@realDonaldTrump	So Robert Mueller has now asked for his long time Never Trumper lawyer to sit beside him and help with answers. Whatâ€™s this all about? His lawyer represented the â€śbasement server guyâ€ť who got off free in the Crooked Hillary case. This should NOT be allowed. Rigged Witch Hunt!

@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats were trying mightily to revive the badly & irrevocably tarnished Witch Hunt Hoax until Robert Mueller put on the greatest display of ineptitude & incompetence that the Halls of Congress have ever seen. Truth is, he had no facts on his side. Nothing he could do!
@realDonaldTrump	Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA, the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats, a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!

His radical â€śoversightâ€ť is a joke!
@realDonaldTrump	There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know, that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district, and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!

@realDonaldTrump	...to ripoff the USA, even bigger and better than ever before. The problem with them waiting, however, is that if & when I win, the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now...or no deal at all. We have all the cards, our past leaders never got it!
@realDonaldTrump	..My team is negotiating with them now, but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit. They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe. Then they could make a GREAT deal, like in past 30 years, and continue
@realDonaldTrump	China is doing very badly, worst year in 27 - was supposed to start buying our agricultural product now - no signs that they are doing so. That is the problem with China, they just donâ€™t come through. Our Economy has become MUCH larger than the Chinese Economy is last 3 years....

@realDonaldTrump	Baltimoreâ€™s numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years, but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!
@realDonaldTrump	Elijah Cummings never even went to the Southern Border and then he screams at the very good people who, despite Congresses failure to fix the Loopholes and Asylum, make it work (crossings are way down and the Wall is being built). Even with zero Dem help, Border getting strong!

He had the TV â€śbugâ€ť & I would let him come on though he (& Erin) had very little..
@realDonaldTrump	.....other than the fact that this Administration has probably done more than any other Administration in its first 2 1/2 years of existence. Anthony, who would do anything to come back in, should remember the only reason he is on TV, and itâ€™s not for being the Mooch!
@realDonaldTrump	Anthony Scaramucci, who was quickly terminated (11 days) from a position that he was totally incapable of handling, now seems to do nothing but television as the all time expert on â€śPresident Trump.â€ť Like many other so-called television experts, he knows very little about me.....
@realDonaldTrump	The United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia. We have similar, though more advanced, technology. The Russian â€śSkyfallâ€ť explosion has people worried about the air around the facility, and far beyond. Not good!
@realDonaldTrump	Two great and loyal friends! https://twitter.com/DiamondandSilk/status/1150453619323363328Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Scaramucci, who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory, is only upset that I didnâ€™t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be). Also, I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you NEGOP! https://twitter.com/NEGOP/status/1160233516535373825Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	It always happens! When a Conservative does even a fraction of what Chris Cuomo did with his lunatic ranting, raving, & cursing, they get destroyed by the Fake News. But when a Liberal Democrat like Chris Cuomo does it, Republicans immediately come to his defense. We never learn!

@realDonaldTrump	Just landed in Pennsylvania. Looking forward to making a speech on energy. So important!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!
@realDonaldTrump	Many are blaming me, and the United States, for the problems going on in Hong Kong. I canâ€™t imagine why?
@realDonaldTrump	ALL THE NEWS THATâ€™S NOT FIT TO PRINT! â€śThe New York Times is no longer the paper we grew up with. It is no longer a news organization. It is now an agenda driven organization out to change the Country (for the worse!).â€ť Michael Goodwin, Highly Respected New York Post Columnist.
@realDonaldTrump	As usual, China said they were going to be buying â€śbigâ€ť from our great American Farmers. So far they have not done what they said. Maybe this will be different!
@realDonaldTrump	Would Chris Cuomo be given a Red Flag for his recent rant? Filthy language and a total loss of control. He shouldnâ€™t be allowed to have any weapon. Heâ€™s nuts!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you Steve! https://twitter.com/CortesSteve/status/1160360266787414017Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Through massive devaluation of their currency and pumping vast sums of money into their system, the tens of billions of dollars that the U.S. is receiving is a gift from China. Prices not up, no inflation. Farmers getting more than China would be spending. Fake News wonâ€™t report!
@realDonaldTrump	I thought Chris was Fredo also. The truth hurts. Totally lost it! Low ratings @CNN https://twitter.com/RealSaavedra/status/1161081413120090113Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Curt Schilling, a great pitcher and patriot, is considering a run for Congress in Arizona. Terrific!  @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	I know President Xi of China very well. He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a â€śtough business.â€ť I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem, he can do it. Personal meeting?
@realDonaldTrump	..deferral to December. It actually helps China more than us, but will be reciprocated. Millions of jobs are being lost in China to other non-Tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!
@realDonaldTrump	Good things were stated on the call with China the other day. They are eating the Tariffs with the devaluation of their currency and â€śpouringâ€ť money into their system. The American consumer is fine with or without the September date, but much good will come from the short.....
@realDonaldTrump	Unlike others, our economy is strong! https://twitter.com/VP/status/1161726809609789442Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	..Spread is way too much as other countries say THANK YOU to clueless Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve. Germany, and many others, are playing the game! CRAZY INVERTED YIELD CURVE! We should easily be reaping big Rewards & Gains, but the Fed is holding us back. We will Win!
@realDonaldTrump	We are winning, big time, against China. Companies & jobs are fleeing. Prices to us have not gone up, and in some cases, have come down. China is not our problem, though Hong Kong is not helping. Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much & too fast. Now too slow to cut....
@realDonaldTrump	The Great Charles Payne @cvpayne correctly stated that Fed Chair Jay Powell made TWO enormous mistakes. 1. When he said â€śmid cycle adjustment.â€ť 2. Weâ€™re data dependent.  â€śHe did not do the right thing.â€ť I agree (to put it mildly!). @Varneyco
@realDonaldTrump	Tremendous amounts of money pouring into the United States. People want safety!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śSo far, youâ€™ve had Tariffs imposed on 300 Billion Dollars worth of Chinese products, but you canâ€™t tell me that it has hurt our economy...& it really hasnâ€™t led to any kind of serious rise in prices at the consumer level.â€ť @Varneyco @FoxBusiness  And we are taking in $Billions!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe Fed has got to do something! The Fed is the Central Bank of the United States, not the Central Bank of the World.â€ť Mark Grant  @Varneyco  Correct! The Federal Reserve acted far too quickly, and now is very, very late. Too bad, so much to gain on the upside!

@realDonaldTrump	Walmart, a great indicator as to how the U.S. is doing, just released outstanding numbers. Our Country, unlike others, is doing great! Donâ€™t let the Fake News convince you otherwise.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śIf they donâ€™t get this Trade Deal with the U.S. done, China could have it first recession (or worse!) in years. Thereâ€™s disinvestment in China right now. Also, the Fed is too tight (I agree).â€ť Steve Moore, Heritage Foundation

@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election. The problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade, and everyone knows that, including China!
@realDonaldTrump	Representatives Omar and Tlaib are the face of the Democrat Party, and they HATE Israel!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! The Deputy Editor of the Failing New York Times was just demoted. Should have been Fired! Totally biased and inaccurate reporting. The paper is a Fraud, Zero Credibility. Fake News takes another hit, but this time a big one!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Great Farmers know how important it is to win on Trade. They will be the big winners!
@realDonaldTrump	The United States is now, by far, the Biggest, Strongest and Most Powerful Economy in the World, it is not even close! As others falter, we will only get stronger. Consumers are in the best shape ever, plenty of cash. Business Optimism is at an All Time High!
@realDonaldTrump	If President Xi would meet directly and personally with the protesters, there would be a happy and enlightened ending to the Hong Kong problem. I have no doubt! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1161774305895694336Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit. They hate Israel & all Jewish people, & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!
@realDonaldTrump	The Philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets. He had a long and very dangerous criminal record. Looked like he was having a good time after his capture, and after wounding so many police. Long sentence - must get much tougher on street crime!
@realDonaldTrump	....what they were doing. Thereâ€™s plenty of indication, we donâ€™t have to speculate.â€ť @SteveDoocy â€śHoly cow, got to read this book.â€ť @ainsleyearhardt â€śWOW!â€ť  @foxandfriends  A very serious situation. Can never be allowed to happen again! DRAIN THE SWAMP
@realDonaldTrump	Go out and get Andrew McCarthyâ€™s new book, â€śBall of Collusion.â€ť â€śSupervision became the investigator, and when they pushed the envelope, there was nobody there to tell them NO. It goes right to the President (Obama). Plenty of information that Obama was informed & knew exactly...

@realDonaldTrump	Like it or not, Tlaib and Omar are fast becoming the face of the Democrat Party. Cortez (AOC) is fuming, not happy about this!
@realDonaldTrump	Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted, whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down, a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaibâ€™s grandmother. She doesnâ€™t have to see her now!
@realDonaldTrump	Israel was very respectful & nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib, allowing her permission to visit her â€śgrandmother.â€ť As soon as she was granted permission, she grandstanded & loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!

@realDonaldTrump	Great time in New Hampshire last night. Placed was maxed out, totally packed, with thousands coming to the arena floor at start. Thousands more outside that were not allowed in per code. Energy was really great to see. We will win New Hampshire in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	The New York Times will be out of business soon after I leave office, hopefully in 6 years. They have Zero credibility and are losing a fortune, even now, especially after their massive unfunded liability. Iâ€™m fairly certain theyâ€™ll endorse me just to keep it all going!

@realDonaldTrump	House Democrats want to take action against Israel because it is fighting back against two (maybe four) people that have said unthinkably bad things about it & the Israeli people. Dems have such disdain for Israel! What happened? AOC Plus 4 is the new face of the Democrat Party!
@realDonaldTrump	Our economy is the best in the world, by far. Lowest unemployment ever within almost all categories. Poised for big growth after trade deals are completed. Import prices down, China eating Tariffs. Helping targeted Farmers from big Tariff money coming in. Great future for USA!
@realDonaldTrump	Juan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic, and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby, he couldnâ€™t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. Yet he is always nasty and wrong!

@realDonaldTrump	.....â€ťJournalismâ€ť has reached a new low in the history of our Country. It is nothing more than an evil propaganda machine for the Democrat Party. The reporting is so false, biased and evil that it has now become a very sick joke...But the public is aware! #CROOKEDJOURNALISM
@realDonaldTrump	The Failing New York Times, in one of the most devastating portrayals of bad journalism in history, got caught by a leaker that they are shifting  from their Phony Russian Collusion Narrative (the Mueller Report & his testimony were a total disaster), to a Racism Witch Hunt.....
@realDonaldTrump	Great discussion with Prime Minister @BorisJohnson today. We talked about Brexit and how we can move rapidly on a US-UK free trade deal. I look forward to meeting with Boris this weekend, at the @G7, in France!
@realDonaldTrump	Spoke to my two good friends, Prime Minister Modi of India, and Prime Minister Khan of Pakistan, regarding Trade, Strategic Partnerships and, most importantly, for India and Pakistan to work towards reducing tensions in Kashmir. A tough situation, but good conversations!

@realDonaldTrump	.....The Fed Rate, over a fairly short period of time, should be reduced by at least 100 basis points, with perhaps some quantitative easing as well. If that happened, our Economy would be even better, and the World Economy would be greatly and quickly enhanced-good for everyone!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Economy is very strong, despite the horrendous lack of vision by Jay Powell and the Fed, but the Democrats are trying to â€świllâ€ť the Economy to be bad for purposes of the 2020 Election.  Very Selfish! Our dollar is so strong that it is sadly hurting other parts of the world...

Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didnâ€™t want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy!
@realDonaldTrump	Anthony Scaramucci is a highly unstable â€śnut jobâ€ť who was with other candidates in the primary who got shellacked, & then unfortunately wheedled his way into my campaign. I barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence-made a fool of himself, bad on TV. Abused staff,...
@realDonaldTrump	Great cohesion inside the Republican Party, the best I have ever seen. Despite all of the Fake News, my Poll Numbers are great. New internal polls show them to be the strongest weâ€™ve had so far! Think what theyâ€™d be if I got fair media coverage!
@realDonaldTrump	....The Prime Minister was able to save a great deal of expense and effort for both the United States and Denmark by being so direct. I thank her for that and look forward to rescheduling sometime in the future!

@realDonaldTrump	....that when this Administrationâ€™s alternative is no longer available, California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative, which is much better for consumers!
@realDonaldTrump	Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesnâ€™t work as well, because execs donâ€™t want to fight California regulators. Car companies should know....
@realDonaldTrump	The Legendary Henry Ford and Alfred P. Sloan, the Founders of Ford Motor Company and General Motors, are â€śrolling overâ€ť at the weakness of current car company executives willing to spend more money on a car that is not as safe or good, and cost $3,000 more to consumers. Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śTax cuts, deregulation, and an Administration dedicated to growing business have allowed the U.S. economy to flourish.

@realDonaldTrump	....WHERE IS THE FEDERAL RESERVE?
@realDonaldTrump	So Germany is paying Zero interest and is actually being paid to borrow money, while the U.S., a far stronger and more important credit, is paying interest and just stopped (I hope!) Quantitative Tightening. Strongest Dollar in History, very tough on exports. No Inflation!.....
@realDonaldTrump	My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!
@realDonaldTrump	.....We are competing with many countries that have a far lower interest rate, and we should be lower than them. Yesterday, â€śhighest Dollar in U.S.History.â€ť No inflation. Wake up Federal Reserve. Such growth potential, almost like never before!
@realDonaldTrump	Doing great with China and other Trade Deals. The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed. Heâ€™s like a golfer who canâ€™t putt, has no touch. Big U.S. growth if he does the right thing, BIG CUT - but donâ€™t count on him! So far he has called it wrong, and only let us down....
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News LameStream Media is doing everything possible the â€ścreateâ€ť a U.S. recession, even though the numbers & facts are working totally in the opposite direction.

@realDonaldTrump	Germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields. Germany competes with the USA. Our Federal Reserve does not allow us to do what we must do. They put us at a disadvantage against our competition. Strong Dollar, No Inflation! They move like quicksand. Fight or go home!

@realDonaldTrump	The two big Congressional wins in North Carolina on Tuesday, Dan Bishop and Greg Murphy, have reverberated all over the World. They showed a lot of people how strong the Republican Party is, and how well it is doing. 2020 is a big, and very important, Election. We will WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	....VERY stupidly negotiated Trade Deals, and Illegal Immigration, are a tremendous cost and burden to our Country. They are BOTH coming along very well and someday, in the not too distant future, America will see a very positive change. Remember, America First!
@realDonaldTrump	Illegal Immigration costs the USA over 300 Billion Dollars a year. There is no reason for this, and things are being set in motion to have this number come WAY DOWN. Democrats could end Loopholes and it would be a whole lot easier, and faster. But it will all happen anyway!....
@realDonaldTrump	....IG Report, which showed him to be a Disgraced & Dirty Cop. Republicans have unified like never before. You donâ€™t impeach Presidents for doing a good (great!) job. No Obstruction, No Collusion, only treasonous crimes committed by the other side, and led by the Democrats. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump	....Became Number 1 in World & Independent in Energy. Will soon have record number of Judges, 2 SC Justices. Done more than any President in first 2 1/2 years despite phony & fraudulent Witch Hunt illegally led against him. WIN on Mueller Report, Mueller Testimony & James Comey..
@realDonaldTrump	How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers, especially for Blacks, Hispanics, Asians & Women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt Military & Choice for Vets...

@realDonaldTrump	Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount....

@realDonaldTrump	Canâ€™t let Brett Kavanaugh give Radical Left Democrat (Liberal Plus) Opinions based on threats of Impeaching him over made up stories (sound familiar?), false allegations, and lies. This is the game they play. Fake and Corrupt News is working overtime! #ProtectKavanaugh
@realDonaldTrump	Brett Kavanaugh should start suing people for libel, or the Justice Department should come to his rescue. The lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Canâ€™t let that happen!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @foxandfriends and @RepMarkMeadows. Great interview!
@realDonaldTrump	Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment. He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!

@realDonaldTrump	....for the privilege of being your President - and doing the best job that has been done in many decades. I am far beyond somebody paying for a hotel room for the evening, or filling up a gas tank at an airport I do not own. These Radical Left Democrats are CRAZY! Obama Netflix?
@realDonaldTrump	They failed on the Mueller Report, they failed on Robert Muellerâ€™s testimony, they failed on everything else, so now the Democrats are trying to build a case that I enrich myself by being President. Good idea, except I will, and have always expected to, lose BILLIONS of DOLLARS..
@realDonaldTrump	â€śDemocrats would rather talk about gun control than get something done.â€ť Governor John Sununu @FoxNews @BillHemmer The big questions are, will they â€śmove the goalpostsâ€ť and, is this just a ploy to TAKE YOUR GUNS AWAY? I hope NOT on both counts, but Iâ€™ll be able to figure it out!
@realDonaldTrump	Remember when Iran shot down a drone, saying knowingly that it was in their â€śairspaceâ€ť when, in fact, it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. Weâ€™ll see?
@realDonaldTrump	Just Out: â€śKavanaugh accuser doesnâ€™t recall incident.â€ť @foxandfriends  DO YOU BELIEVE WHAT THESE HORRIBLE PEOPLE WILL DO OR SAY. They are looking to destroy, and influence his opinions - but played the game badly. They should be sued!

@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe New York Times walks back report on Kavanaugh assault claim.â€ť @foxandfriends  The one who is actually being assaulted is Justice Kavanaugh - Assaulted by lies and Fake News! This is all about the LameStream Media working with their partner, the Dems.
@realDonaldTrump	...The United States, because of the Federal Reserve, is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries. They canâ€™t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell & the Fed donâ€™t have a clue. And now, on top of it all, the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop, Stimulus!
@realDonaldTrump	Producer prices in China shrank most in 3 years due to Chinaâ€™s big devaluation of their currency, coupled with monetary stimulus. Federal Reserve not watching? Will Fed ever get into the game? Dollar strongest EVER! Really bad for exports. No Inflation...Highest Interest Rates...
@realDonaldTrump	Because we have done so well with Energy over the last few years (thank you, Mr. President!), we are a net Energy Exporter, & now the Number One Energy Producer in the World. We donâ€™t need Middle Eastern Oil & Gas, & in fact have very few tankers there, but will help our Allies!

Then look at all the deals made by the Dems in Congress, the â€śCongressional Slush Fund,â€ť and lastly the IG Reports. Take a look at them. Those investigations would be over FAST!
@realDonaldTrump	House Judiciary has given up on the Mueller Report, sadly for them after two years and $40,000,000 spent - ZERO COLLUSION, ZERO OBSTRUCTION. So they say, OK, lets look at everything else, and all of the deals that â€śTrumpâ€ť has done over his lifetime. But it doesnâ€™t....

@realDonaldTrump	The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE.....

@realDonaldTrump	.....The Kurds and Turkey have been fighting for many years. Turkey considers the PKK the worst terrorists of all. Others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other. Let them! We are monitoring the situation closely. Endless Wars!
@realDonaldTrump	Do you remember two years ago when Iraq was going to fight the Kurds in a different part of Syria. Many people wanted us to fight with the Kurds against Iraq, who we just fought for. I said no, and the Kurds left the fight, twice. Now the same thing is happening with Turkey......
@realDonaldTrump	Very smart not to be involved in the intense fighting along the Turkish Border, for a change. Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?
@realDonaldTrump	The Media is not talking about the big Republican victory last night in Louisiana where a sitting Democrat Governor was forced into a runoff by not getting 50%. Big upset! Now @EddieRispone, who will be a great Governor, will win!

@realDonaldTrump	The Governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN, @EddieRispone. Thank you Louisiana! 66% down to 47% after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.

@realDonaldTrump	....and Assad to protect the land of our enemy? Anyone who wants to assist Syria in protecting the Kurds is good with me, whether it is Russia, China, or Napoleon Bonaparte. I hope they all do great, we are 7,000 miles away!
@realDonaldTrump	After defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate, I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land. I said to my Generals, why should we be fighting for Syria....
@realDonaldTrump	....Don't the Europeans have a lot of responsibility?â€ť @KatiePavlich Thank you Katie, I offered ISIS prisoners to the European countries from where they came, and was rejected on numerous occasions. They probably figured that the U.S. would bear the tremendous cost as always!

@realDonaldTrump	Senator Rand Paul just wrote a great book, â€śThe Case Against Socialismâ€ť which is now out. Highly recommended â€“ as America was founded on LIBERTY & INDEPENDENCE â€“ not government coercion, domination & control. We were born free, and will stay free, as long as I am your President!
@realDonaldTrump	Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers, no questions, no transparency! The good news is that the Radical Left Dems have No Case. It is all based on their Fraud and Fabrication!
@realDonaldTrump	Our record Economy would CRASH, just like in 1929, if any of those clowns became President!
@realDonaldTrump	95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party. Thank you! Just won two Congressional Seats in North Carolina,  & a Governors runoff in Louisiana, which Republicans should now win! Because of Impeachment Fraud, we will easily take back the House, add in the Senate, & again win Pres!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śWhat is happening to President Trump with Impeachment is a Constitutional Travesty.â€ť @GrahamLedger  The likes of which we have never seen before. It is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!
@realDonaldTrump	You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States. Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!

@realDonaldTrump	Shifty Adam Schiff wants to rest his entire case on a Whistleblower who he now says canâ€™t testify, & the reason he canâ€™t testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the Presidential telephone call is a fraud & totally different from the actual transcribed call...

@realDonaldTrump	â€śAbout 500,000 human beings were killed in Syria while Barack Obama was president & leading for a â€śpolitical settlementâ€ť to that civil war.

@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to President @RTErdogan of Turkey. He told me there was minor sniper and mortar fire that was quickly eliminated. He very much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work. Likewise, the Kurds want it, and the ultimate solution, to happen. Too bad there wasnâ€™t.....

@realDonaldTrump	Pelosi and Impeachment - There have already been 3 Votes, and theyâ€™ve all failed miserably. Hereâ€™s why there may not be a fourth - 137 Democrats voted against on the last vote.â€ť @JasonChaffetz @seanhannity  Many of those voting in favor will be beaten in 2020!
@realDonaldTrump	Congressman Michael McCaul, â€śSchiffâ€™s inquiry defies Democracy.â€ť @FoxNews @seanhannity

@realDonaldTrump	Corrupt Congressman Adam Schiff is angry that Ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent Witch Hunt, are turning out to be good for me - some really good! Heâ€™s got all meetings locked down, no transparency, only his illegal leaks. A very dishonest sleazebag!
@realDonaldTrump	So interesting that, when I announced Trump National Doral in Miami would be used for the hosting of the G-7, and then rescinded due to Do Nothing Democrat/Fake News Anger, very few in Media mentioned that NO PROFITS would be taken, or would be given FREE, if legally permissible!
@realDonaldTrump	....fiction to Congress and the American People?  I demand his deposition. He is a fraud, just like the Russia Hoax was, and the Ukraine Hoax is now. When do the Do Nothing Democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our Country, & when do the Republicans finally fight back?
@realDonaldTrump	....because their so-called story didnâ€™t come even close to matching up with the exact transcript of the phone call. Was it a Corrupt Adam Schiff con? Why didnâ€™t the IG see this? When do we depose Shifty Schiff to find out why he fraudulently made up my phone call and read this..
@realDonaldTrump	This Scam going on right now by the Democrats against the Republican Party, and me, was all about a perfect phone call I had with the Ukrainian President. Heâ€™s already stated, NO PRESSURE! Where is the Whistleblower, or the 2nd Whistleblower, or the â€śinformant?â€ť All gone.....
@realDonaldTrump	Pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9, including Corrupt Adam Schiff, to Jordan to check out Syria. She should find out why Obama drew The Red Line In the Sand, & then did NOTHING, losing Syria & all respect. I did something, 58 missiles. One million died under Obamaâ€™s mistake!

@realDonaldTrump	....USA has gained Trillions of Dollars in wealth since November 2016. All others way down. Our power is Economic before having to use our newly rebuilt Military, a much better alternative. Oil is secured. Our soldiers have left and are leaving Syria for other places, then....

@realDonaldTrump	Nervous Nancy Pelosi is doing everything possible to destroy the Republican Party. Our Polls show that it is going to be just the opposite. The Do Nothing Dems will lose many seats in 2020. They have a Death Wish, led by a corrupt politician, Adam Schiff!

@realDonaldTrump	How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT! I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?), which was fine with me, but why so many?
@realDonaldTrump	The Do Nothing Democrats are working hard to make everyone forget the Best Economy Ever, the monumental weekend raid, Tax Cuts, the Rebuilding of our Military, etc. The Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace. Read the transcript!

@realDonaldTrump	The only crimes in the Impeachment Hoax were committed by Shifty Adam Schiff, when he totally made up my phone conversation with the Ukrainian President and read it to Congress, together with numerous others on Shiftyâ€™s side. Schiff should be Impeached, and worse!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThere is no underlying crime in that transcript.â€ť @IngrahamAngle  100% correct, and the Whistleblower disappeared after I released the transcript of the call. Where is the Whistleblower? That is why this is now called the Impeachment Hoax! The Do Nothing Dems are Doing Nothing!

@realDonaldTrump	I got Impeached last night without one Republican vote being cast with the Do Nothing Dems on their continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American history. Now the Do Nothing Party want to Do Nothing with the Articles & not deliver them to the Senate, but itâ€™s Senateâ€™s call!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe Senate shall set the time and place of the trial.â€ť If the Do Nothing Democrats decide, in their great wisdom, not to show up, they would lose by Default!

@realDonaldTrump	I guess the magazine, â€śChristianity Today,â€ť is looking for Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, or those of the socialist/communist bent, to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is, no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals, or religion itself!
@realDonaldTrump	Had a very good talk with President Xi of China concerning our giant Trade Deal. China has already started large scale purchaes of agricultural product & more. Formal signing being arranged. Also talked about North Korea, where we are working with China, & Hong Kong (progress!).
@realDonaldTrump	I will be signing our 738 Billion Dollar Defense Spending Bill today. It will include 12 weeks  Paid Parental Leave, gives our troops a raise, importantly creates the SPACE FORCE, SOUTHERN BORDER WALL FUNDING, repeals â€śCadillac Taxâ€ť on Health Plans, raises smoking age to 21!

@realDonaldTrump	The reason the Democrats donâ€™t want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they donâ€™t want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath, nor do they want the Whistleblower, the missing second Whistleblower, the informer, the Bidens, to testify!
@realDonaldTrump	The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax. The Republicans have never been so united!  The Demâ€™s case is so bad that they donâ€™t even want to go to trial!
@realDonaldTrump	So after the Democrats gave me no Due Process in the House, no lawyers, no witnesses, no nothing, they now want to tell the Senate how to run their trial. Actually, they have zero proof of anything, they will never even show up. They want out. I want an immediate trial!
@realDonaldTrump	Last night I was so proud to have signed the largest Defense Bill ever. The very vital Space Force was created. New planes, ships, missiles, rockets and equipment of every kind, and all made right here in the USA. Additionally, we got Border Wall (being built) funding. Nice!

@realDonaldTrump	....What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial. None! She has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision. This Witch Hunt must end NOW with a trial in the Senate, or let her default & lose. No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi, who has already lost the House & Speakership once, & is about to lose it again, is doing everything she can to delay the zero Republican vote Articles of Impeachment. She is trying to take over the Senate, & Cryinâ€™ Chuck is trying to take over the trial. No way!....

It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers. Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!

@realDonaldTrump	As hard as I work, & as successful as our Country has become with our Economy, our Military & everything else, it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time & money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax. I should be able to devote all of my time to the REAL USA!

@realDonaldTrump	Congress & the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote, & we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!
@realDonaldTrump	The Impeachment Hoax, just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election, must end quickly. Read the Transcripts, see the Ukrainian Presidentâ€™s strong statement, NO PRESSURE - get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic.â€ť @LindseyGrahamSC @MariaBartiromo  The great Scam continues.

@realDonaldTrump	Now the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, are asking @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell to do the job that they were unable to do. They proved NOTHING but my total innocence in the House, despite the most unfair & biased hearings in the history of Congress. Now they demand fairness!
@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!
@realDonaldTrump	New polling shows that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is going nowhere. A vast majority want the Do Nothing Democrats to move on to other things now!
@realDonaldTrump	Where have the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani, one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? He was also looking to do big future damage! Dems are â€śunhinged.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	â€śFBI Director apologizes for FISA Errors (of which there were far to many to be a coincidence!).â€ť @FoxNews Chris, what about all of the lives that were ruined because of the so-called â€śerrors?â€ť Are these â€śdirty copsâ€ť going to pay a big price for the fraud they committed?
@realDonaldTrump	National Security Adviser suggested today that sanctions & protests have Iran â€śchoked offâ€ť, will force them to negotiate. Actually, I couldnâ€™t care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but, no nuclear weapons and â€śdonâ€™t kill your protesters.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	Many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, â€śno pressureâ€ť  Impeachment Hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. I agree!

@realDonaldTrump	Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did NOTHING wrong? Read the Transcripts! A totally partisan Hoax, never happened before. House Republicans voted 195-0, with three Dems voting with the Republicans. Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!
@realDonaldTrump	Why did Nervous Nancy allow corrupt politician Shifty Schiff to lie before Congress? He must be a Witness, and so should she!
@realDonaldTrump	Great idea. This phony Impeachment Hoax should not even be allowed to proceed. Did NOTHING wrong. Just a partisan vote. Zero Republicans. Never happened before! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1216212972391096320Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	John Kerry got caught essentially admitting that funds given ridiculously to Iran were used to fund attacks on the USA. Only a complete fool would have given that 150 Billion Dollars Plus to Iran. They then went on a Middle East Rampage! @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth
@realDonaldTrump	George @GStephanopoulos, ask Crazy Nancy why she allowed Adam â€śShiftyâ€ť Schiff to totally make up my conversation with the Ukrainian President & read his false words to Congress and the world, as though I said it? He got caught! Ask why hearing was most unfair & biased in history?
@realDonaldTrump	To the leaders of Iran - DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS. Thousands have already been killed or imprisoned by you, and the World is watching. More importantly, the USA is watching. Turn your internet back on and let reporters roam free! Stop the killing of your great Iranian people!

@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media and their Democrat Partners are working hard to determine whether or not the future attack by terrorist Soleimani was â€śimminentâ€ť or not, & was my team in agreement. The answer to both is a strong YES., but it doesnâ€™t really matter because of his horrible past!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on, or in any way denigrate, our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it, and they walked around it instead. Big progress!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy, only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do, whether itâ€™s the economy, military, or anything else, will be scorned by the Rafical Left, Do Nothing Democrats!

@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe GOA got it exactly backwards. Hereâ€™s what they said. The law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities to those Congress has enacted into law.

@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. This is sometimes done, but really not fair!
@realDonaldTrump	Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldnâ€™t do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact, Bloomberg isnâ€™t covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! Itâ€™s all the Fake News Media, and thatâ€™s why nobody believes in them any more.
@realDonaldTrump	The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, donâ€™t want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, & that includes the House & Senate.

@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to everyone for all of the great reviews I have gotten on my State of the Union Speech. It was an immense honor for me to have presented it to you and the citizens of our very strong and wonderful Country!
@realDonaldTrump	...But, just like the people of West Virginia will no longer look at weak & pathetic Joe Manchin the same (I got the Pension Bill approved, Manchin couldnâ€™t do it), the wonderful people of Utah will never look at â€śgrandstanderâ€ť Mitt Romney with anything but contempt & disgust!
@realDonaldTrump	Canâ€™t say I mind the fact that the great people of West Virginia are furious at their puppet Democrat Senator, Joe Manchin. They will never forget his phony vote on the Impeachment Hoax. All he had to do is read the Transcripts, sadly, which he wouldnâ€™t understand anyway.....

@realDonaldTrump	Great lineup on @FoxNews tonight with @JesseBWatters, @JudgeJeanine and & @greggutfeld. All starts at 8:00 P.M. Will be discussing and explaining the Impeachment Hoax!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śA lot of people feel defeated...Trump always wins. It seems like nothing can stop him.â€ť Danny Villazon  @nytimes @DanaPerino @FoxNews  But isnâ€™t that what you want from your President?

@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to @mirandadevine of the New York Post for your interesting (and correct) column today. â€śTrump has gained 20 points since Impeachment began in October. He gets 67% on economy. Nonwhite approval of Trump is also at a high: 28%, up 10 points in a year. Nice one, Nancy.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	Hope the Fake News, which never discusses it, is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They wonâ€™t!
@realDonaldTrump	Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax, AOC will primary Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer, and win, and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House, AGAIN! My poll numbers great.
@realDonaldTrump	95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a Record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). Corrupt Democrat politicians have brought me to highest polling numbers ever with the Impeachment Hoax. Thank you Nancy!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be in Manchester, New Hampshire, tonight for a big Rally. Want to shake up the Dems a little bit - they have a really boring deal going on. Still waiting for the Iowa results, votes were fried. Big crowds in Manchester!
@realDonaldTrump	When Jerome Powell started his testimony today, the Dow was up 125, & heading higher. As he spoke it drifted steadily downward, as usual, and is now at -15. Germany & other countries get paid to borrow money. We are more prime, but Fed Rate is too high, Dollar tough on exports.
@realDonaldTrump	New Stock Market RECORD. Congratulations, spend your money wisely. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!!

@realDonaldTrump	Two months in jail for a Swamp Creature, yet 9 years recommended for Roger Stone (who was not even working for the Trump Campaign). Gee, that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp! @foxandfriends @TuckerCarlson
@realDonaldTrump	Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!
@realDonaldTrump	Fake News @CNN and MSDNC have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in New Hampshire (and in Iowa). Thatâ€™s why they are poorly rated Fake News! I will win both states in November.
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media is looking hard for the Big Democrat Story, but there is nothing too fabulous. Wouldnâ€™t a big story be that I got more New Hampshire Primary Votes than any incumbent president, in either party, in the history of that Great State? Not an insignificant fact!

@realDonaldTrump	Who are the four prosecutors (Mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal, the Mueller Scam, and shouldnâ€™t ever even have started? 13 Angry Democrats?
@realDonaldTrump	Impeachment King Steyer (how did that work out?) spent 200 Million Dollars and got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa, and only 3% of the Vote in New Hampshire. Could it be that something is just plain missing? Not easy to do what I did, is it?
@realDonaldTrump	Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is having a really bad night. I think she is sending signals that she wants out. Calling for unity is her way of getting there, going home, and having a â€śnice cold beerâ€ť with her husband!
@realDonaldTrump	Whatever happened to Hillary campaign manager Podestaâ€™s BROTHER? Wasnâ€™t he caught, forced to leave his firm, with BIG BAD things to happen? Why did nothing ever happen to him, only to the â€śotherâ€ť side?
@realDonaldTrump	...And a swamp creature with â€śpullâ€ť was just sentenced to two months in jail for a similar thing that they want Stone to serve 9 years for. A phony Mueller Witch Hunt disgrace. Caught! https://twitter.com/CBS_Herridge/status/1227286163939000320Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	When I terminated John Kelly, which I couldnâ€™t do fast enough, he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasnâ€™t for him.

@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike Bloomberg is a LOSER who has money but canâ€™t debate and has zero presence, you will see.

@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike Bloomberg didnâ€™t bring NYC back, as he said in his fake ad. It was @RudyGiuliani who brought NYC back and who also, with his endorsement, got Mini Mike elected (with barely a thank you). A boring mayor who the people couldnâ€™t stand!

@realDonaldTrump	....paying higher rates than many others, when we should be paying less. Tough on our exporters and puts the USA at a competitive disadvantage. Must be the other way around. Should ease and cut rate big. Jerome Powell led Federal Reserve has called it wrong from day one. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump	Australiaâ€™s Central Bank cut interest rates and stated it will most likely further ease in order to make up for Chinaâ€™s Coronavirus situation and slowdown. They reduced to 0.5%, a record low. Other countries are doing the same thing, if not more so. Our Federal Reserve has us....

@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike, â€śThree months ago I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump, (and I failed miserably!).
@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim Oâ€™Brien, and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS. This has been the worst, and most embarrassing, experience of his life...and now on to Sleepy Joe!
@realDonaldTrump	Mini Mike Bloomberg just â€śquitâ€ť the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didnâ€™t have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joeâ€™s campaign, hoping to save face. It wonâ€™t work!
@realDonaldTrump	The Mayor of Los Angeles, @ericgarcetti, is dealing with us trying to get the Federal Government to fix the terrible problem he and the Dems have caused with the homeless, and the horrendous effects it is having on the City, which is a mess. I then watch him talk â€śtrashâ€ť on me!
@realDonaldTrump	Wow! If Elizabeth Warren wasnâ€™t in the race, Bernie Sanders would have EASILY won Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas, not to mention various other states. Our modern day Pocahontas wonâ€™t go down in history as a winner, but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER!
@realDonaldTrump	The great people of Montana can have no better VOICE than Senator @SteveDaines. He is doing an incredible job! Whoever the Democrat nominee may be, please understand that I will be working hard with Steve all the way, & last night I was 20 for 20 (per @GOPLeader). WE NEED STEVE!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be going to the Great State of Tennessee on Friday. The USA stands with the people of Tennessee 100%, whatever they need! The tornadoes were of record size & velocity. God bless your loved ones & all of the families affected! Thanks to @GovBillLee & @MarshaBlackburn
@realDonaldTrump	MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then, KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!
@realDonaldTrump	This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesnâ€™t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt.

@realDonaldTrump	So selfish for Elizabeth Warren to stay in the race. She has Zero chance of even coming close to winning, but hurts Bernie badly. So much for their wonderful liberal friendship. Will he ever speak to her again? She cost him Massachusetts (and came in third), he shouldnâ€™t!
@realDonaldTrump	The Democrat establishment came together and crushed Bernie Sanders, AGAIN! Even the fact that Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race was devastating to Bernie and allowed Sleepy Joe to unthinkably win Massachusetts. It was a perfect storm, with many good states remaining for Joe!

@realDonaldTrump	The biggest loser tonight, by far, is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His â€śpoliticalâ€ť consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!

@realDonaldTrump	Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation. The April 2009-10 Swine Flu, where nearly 13,000 people died in the U.S., was poorly handled. Ask MSDNC & lightweight Washington failure @RonaldKlain, who the President was then?
@realDonaldTrump	The Department of Education is NOT closing hundreds of schools in rural areas of our Country. This is just more Fake News. We are investing greatly in our schools, and always will!

@realDonaldTrump	With approximately 100,000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide, and 3,280 deaths, the United States, because of quick action on closing our borders, has, as of now, only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!

@realDonaldTrump	Elizabeth â€śPocahontasâ€ť Warren, who was going nowhere except into Mini Mikeâ€™s head, just dropped out of the Democrat Primary...THREE DAYS TOO LATE. She cost Crazy Bernie, at least, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas. Probably cost him the nomination! Came in third in Mass.
@realDonaldTrump	.@GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy informed me that I was 20 for 20 on Tuesday with respect to my Endorsement of candidates. Sadly, I didnâ€™t get that information from the Fake News Media. They donâ€™t report those things, or the far more than Dems cumulative votes, despite no opposition!

@realDonaldTrump	We have a perfectly coordinated and fine tuned plan at the White House for our attack on CoronaVirus. We moved VERY early to close borders to certain areas, which was a Godsend. V.P. is doing a great job. The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. Sad!

@realDonaldTrump	We have now learned for sure that the Democrats donâ€™t want anything to do with Crazy Bernie. Rigged?

@realDonaldTrump	So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!

@realDonaldTrump	Now the Democrats are trying to smear Bernie with Russia, Russia, Russia. They are driving him Crazy!
@realDonaldTrump	Elizabeth â€śPocahontasâ€ť Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?
@realDonaldTrump	Cryinâ€™ Chuck Schumer said, â€śYou will pay the price for this. You wonâ€™t know what HIT YOU.â€ť That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat, or at least a threat that you better vote for us.â€ť Trouble ahead!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, â€śThe risk is low to the average American.â€ť

@realDonaldTrump	Tommy Tuberville (@TTuberville) is running for the U.S. Senate from the Great State of Alabama. Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University. He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! Tommy will protect your Second Amendment....

@realDonaldTrump	Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted â€ścoupâ€ť of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!
@realDonaldTrump	â€śNancy Pelosi all of a sudden doesnâ€™t like the payroll tax cut, but when Obama proposed it she thought it was a brilliant thing that all of the working families would benefit from because if you get a paycheck, youâ€™re going to take home more money.â€ť @kilmeade @foxandfriends
@realDonaldTrump	Hoping to get the payroll tax cut approved by both Republicans and Democrats, and please remember, very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.
@realDonaldTrump	Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on earth...We will remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need, and that they are entitled to. No resource will be spared. pic.twitter.com/gySUqewd4u
@realDonaldTrump	....No matter where you may be, I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together, we will easily PREVAIL!
@realDonaldTrump	It is my great honor to declare Sunday, March 15th as a National Day of Prayer. We are a Country that, throughout our history, has looked to God for protection and strength in times like these....
@realDonaldTrump	At my request, effective midnight tonight, Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian, and MSC have all agreed to suspend outbound cruises for thirty days. It is a great and important industry â€“ it will be kept that way!

@realDonaldTrump	To unleash the full power of the Federal Government in this effort, today I am officially declaring a National Emergency. pic.twitter.com/yu2GBcxWD6
@realDonaldTrump	I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M., The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!
@realDonaldTrump	To this point, and because we have had a very strong border policy, we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders, that number would be many times higher!
@realDonaldTrump	The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic & physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also, STIMULATE!
@realDonaldTrump	If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently, let them have the full money that they earned, APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year, December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!
@realDonaldTrump	.... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster, with thousands dying, and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem, until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut, ready to go!
@realDonaldTrump	For decades the @CDCgov looked at, and studied,  its testing system, but did nothing about it. It would always be inadequate and slow for a large scale pandemic, but a pandemic would never happen, they hoped. President Obama made changes that only complicated things further.....
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Bidenâ€™s remarks, and any alarm that he might have caused, an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency, and that killed 12,000 Americans.â€ť @LouDobbs
@realDonaldTrump	Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record. His was lowest!
@realDonaldTrump	Just had a great conversation with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I told him that the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent. He has done an incredible job, one that will make him very proud. Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister. Lots of options!
@realDonaldTrump	Tomorrow I have called for a National Day of Prayer. I will be tuning in to Pastor @Jentezen at the @FreeChapel Church in Gainesville, Georgia at 11:00 AM EDT. God Bless the USA!  http://freechapel.org/liveÂ  https://twitter.com/Jentezen/status/1238804829654450178Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The @CDCgov has published guidelines on  http://CoronaVirus.govÂ  to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families and their communities.
@realDonaldTrump	Just had a nice conversation with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau of Canada. Great to hear that his wonderful wife Sophie is doing very well. The United States and Canada will continue to coordinate closely together on COVID-19.

@realDonaldTrump	I fully support H.R. 6201: Families First CoronaVirus Response Act, which will be voted on in the House this evening. This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests, and paid sick leave for our impacted American workers. I have directed....
@realDonaldTrump	The individual Governors of States, and local officials, must step up their efforts on drive up testing and testing sights, working in conjunction with @CDCgov and the Federal Government!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these, they are not truthful. Watch for their apology, it wonâ€™t happen. More importantly, thank you to Google! https://twitter.com/Google_Comms/status/1238989156610707456Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	So now it is reported that, after destroying his life & the life of his wonderful family (and many others also), the FBI, working in conjunction with the Justice Department, has â€ślostâ€ť the records of General Michael Flynn. How convenient. I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!
@realDonaldTrump	Canâ€™t believe they are not going after Schumer for the threats he made to our cherished United States Supreme Court, and our two great Justices. If a Republican did that, there would be an endless price to pay. Pathetic!
@realDonaldTrump	....The USA was never set up for this, just look at the catastrophe of the H1N1 Swine Flu (Biden in charge, 17,000 people lost, very late response time), but it soon will be. Great decision to close our China, and other, borders early. Saved many lives!
@realDonaldTrump	There will be a News Conference by the CoronaVirus Task Force today at the White House, 5 P.M. @VP  We are working closely with the Governors of our Countryâ€™s great States, which are a very big factor. They are working hard, along with us, to get the job properly done.....
@realDonaldTrump	We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports. Pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!

@realDonaldTrump	The United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus. We will be stronger than ever before!
@realDonaldTrump	I ask all Americans to band together and support your neighbors by not hoarding unnecessary amounts of food and essentials. TOGETHER we will stay STRONG and overcome this challenge!
@realDonaldTrump	Yesterday I spoke with the great American Grocers and Supply Chain Executives. We are confident that supply will continue to meet demand nationwide. These beacons of our community will remain open for you, no matter what. We are working hard to remove any barriers to that effort!
@realDonaldTrump	Just had a  very good tele-conference with Nationâ€™s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to â€śdo moreâ€ť.
@realDonaldTrump	Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!
@realDonaldTrump	God Bless the USA!
@realDonaldTrump	I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. Thatâ€™s what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!
@realDonaldTrump	The world is at war with a hidden enemy. WE WILL WIN!
@realDonaldTrump	Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS
@realDonaldTrump	Failing  Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!
@realDonaldTrump	Cuomo wants â€śall states to be treated the same.â€ť But all states arenâ€™t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus, some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big â€śhotspotâ€ť, West Virginia has, thus far, zero cases. Andrew, keep politics out of it....

@realDonaldTrump	95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, 53% overall. Not bad considering I get nothing but Fake & Corrupt News, day and night. â€śRussia, Russia, Russiaâ€ť, then â€śthe Ukraine Scam (whereâ€™s the Whistleblower?)â€ť, the â€śImpeachment Hoaxâ€ť, and more, more, more....
@realDonaldTrump	The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule. Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon! MAGA/KAG
@realDonaldTrump	I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the â€śbordersâ€ť from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!
@realDonaldTrump	I will be having a news conference today to discuss very important news from the FDA concerning the Chinese Virus!
@realDonaldTrump	I will totally protect your Medicare & Social Security!
@realDonaldTrump	For the people that are now out of work because of the important and necessary containment policies, for instance the shutting down of hotels, bars and restaurants, money will soon be coming to you. The onslaught of the Chinese Virus is not your fault! Will be stronger than ever!

@realDonaldTrump	I watch and listen to the Fake News, CNN, MSDNC, ABC, NBC, CBS, some of FOX (desperately & foolishly pleading to be politically correct), the @nytimes, & the @washingtonpost, and all I see is hatred of me at any cost. Donâ€™t they understand that they are destroying themselves?
@realDonaldTrump	My friend (always there when Iâ€™ve needed him!), Senator @RandPaul, was just tested â€śpositiveâ€ť from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits.
@realDonaldTrump	Price transparency is so important for the people of our Country. In many ways, it will prove to be as important as healthcare itself. A great issue for both Republicans and Democrats. Hopefully it will be approved!
@realDonaldTrump	Will be doing a Town Hall on @FoxNews at 12:05 P.M. (Now). I will go on around 1:00 P.M. Enjoy!
@realDonaldTrump	Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!
@realDonaldTrump	Congress must approve the deal, without all of the nonsense, today. The longer it takes, the harder it will be to start up our economy. Our workers will be hurt!
@realDonaldTrump	This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!

@realDonaldTrump	....us since the beginning of this crisis.â€ť They meant the opposite? Forgot to mention that I closed our Country to China (and Europe) very early, long before it was considered acceptable to do so. Sleepy Joe said I was â€śxenophobicâ€ť, but I saved thousands of lives! Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	This is the way the @nytimes finished a story on me. â€śYou can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that VP Biden (Sleepy Joe) has shown, and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. (not Pres.) Trump has shown....

@realDonaldTrump	I hear that Fake News CNN just reported that I am isolated in the White House, wondering out loud, â€śwhen will life return to normal?â€ť Does anybody really believe that? There was no leak, they made it up â€“ they are CORRUPT & FAKE NEWS....

@realDonaldTrump	We are marshalling the full power of government and society to achieve victory over the virus. Together, we will endure, we will prevail, and we will WIN! #CARESAct pic.twitter.com/zb2PJTldGQ
@realDonaldTrump	I just signed the CARES Act, the single biggest economic relief package in American History â€“ twice as large as any relief bill ever enacted. At $2.2 Trillion Dollars, this bill will deliver urgently-needed relief for our nationâ€™s families, workers, and businesses. #CARESActđź‡şđź‡¸ https://twitter.com/SenateGOP/status/1243613618186465280Â â€¦

@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Rachel @Maddow for putting our Military on full display, and showing how GREAT a job the Federal Government is doing! Also, a special thanks to General Semonite, a Patriot of the highest order and a truly talented engineer and builder! pic.twitter.com/JRQlNpLbxv

@realDonaldTrump	Thousand of Federal Government (delivered) Ventilators found in New York storage. N.Y. must distribute NOW!
@realDonaldTrump	Will someone please explain to the Fake News New York Times (ALL THE NEWS THATâ€™S NOT FIT TO PRINT) that the Democrats make it almost impossible for us to fill positions within government. They â€śmaximumâ€ť delay even the best candidates, including Judges, leaving little time!
@realDonaldTrump	We have just purchased many Ventilators from some wonderful companies. Names and numbers will be announced later today!
@realDonaldTrump	Invoke â€śPâ€ť means Defense Production Act!
@realDonaldTrump	General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio, or some other plant, and START MAKING VENTILATORS, NOW!!!!!!  FORD, GET GOING ON VENTILATORS, FAST!!!!!!  @GeneralMotors @Ford
@realDonaldTrump	As usual with â€śthisâ€ť General Motors, things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40,000 much needed Ventilators, â€śvery quicklyâ€ť. Now they are saying it will only be 6000, in late April, and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke â€śPâ€ť.
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you Byron. Many polls are much better than this. If it is the Fake News @washingtonpost, add 10 points! https://twitter.com/ByronYork/status/1243484004403339265Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	By empowering the Radical Left Democrats, do nothing Kentucky politician @RepThomasMassie is making their War on the 2nd Amendment more and more difficult to win (But donâ€™t worry, we will win anyway!). He is a disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!
@realDonaldTrump	...& costly. Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasnâ€™t their fault. It is â€śHELLâ€ť dealing with the Dems, had to give up some stupid things in order to get the â€śbig pictureâ€ť done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE, but throw Massie out of Republican Party!
@realDonaldTrump	Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie, a Congressman from, unfortunately, a truly GREAT State, Kentucky, wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress. He just wants the publicity. He canâ€™t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous......
@realDonaldTrump	Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!
@realDonaldTrump	With the courage of our doctors and nurses, with the skill of our scientists and innovators, with the determination of the American People, and with the grace of God, WE WILL WIN THIS WAR. When we achieve this victory, we will emerge stronger and more united than ever before! pic.twitter.com/sFmxKzXdGC

@realDonaldTrump	....very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources, very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that, the media would be trusted again, and Fake News would largely be a thing of the past!
@realDonaldTrump	One of the reasons that Fake News has become so prevalent & far reaching is the fact that corrupt â€śjournalistsâ€ť base their stories on SOURCES that they make up in order to totally distort a narrative or story. When you see, â€śfive sources sayâ€ť, donâ€™t believe the story, it is....
@realDonaldTrump	So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. These are very dangerous & corrupt people, who will do anything to win. NAME YOUR SOURCES!
@realDonaldTrump	More Fake News! https://twitter.com/Santucci/status/1243708703972433927Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Such Fake reporting by the @nytimes, @washingtonpost, @CNN & others. They use a small portion of a sentence out of a full paragraph in order to demean. They really are corrupt and disgusting. No wonder the media is, according to polls, record setting low & untrusted.  #MAGA
@realDonaldTrump	I love Michigan, one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor, Gretchen â€śHalfâ€ť Whitmer is way in over her head, she doesnâ€™t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA

@realDonaldTrump	So proud of the @USACEHQ, @FEMA, and the Federal Government for the 2,900 bed hospital they built in 4 days (way ahead of schedule) in the Javits Center for NY. We are now moving the teams to join others so they can continue to build more hospitals/beds. Keep up the GREAT WORK!
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you very much to Ken Langone for being a great American and for your wonderful comments on @TeamCavuto.
@realDonaldTrump	I am a great friend and admirer of the Queen & the United Kingdom. It was reported that Harry and Meghan, who left the Kingdom, would reside permanently in Canada. Now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!

@realDonaldTrump	â€śPresident Trump is a ratings hit. Since reviving the daily White House briefing Mr. Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on cable news, roughly the viewership of the season finale of â€The Bachelor.â€™ Numbers are continuing to rise...
@realDonaldTrump	Because the â€śRatingsâ€ť of my News Conferences etc. are so high, â€śBachelor finale, Monday Night Football type numbersâ€ť according to the @nytimes, the Lamestream Media is going CRAZY. â€śTrump is reaching too many people, we must stop him.â€ť said one lunatic. See you at 5:00 P.M.!
@realDonaldTrump	Polls are showing tremendous disapproval of Lamestream Media coverage of the Virus crisis. The Fake News just hasnâ€™t figured that out yet!
@realDonaldTrump	The Lamestream Media wants us to fail. That will NEVER happen!
@realDonaldTrump	Hope the FDA can approve Mask Sterilization equipment ASAP. As per Governor @MikeDeWine, there is a company in Ohio, @Battelle, which has equipment that can sterilize masks quickly.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śWith the Tax Cuts and new Trade Deals, we were set for a tremendous growth rate this year.... and then the Virus came along.â€ť @larry_kudlow @MariaBartiromo We were breaking all records, especially on employment. It will all come roaring back again, and fast!

@realDonaldTrump	Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats delayed the Workers Help/Stimulus Bill by over a week, trying to add real â€śjunkâ€ť into the Bill. Got some bad things, having nothing to do with those affected by the Virus, included. Republicans need their votes until we WIN BACK THE HOUSE IN 2020!

@realDonaldTrump	I watched a portion of low rated (very) Morning Psycho (Joe) this Morning in order to see what Nancy Pelosi had to say, & what moves she was planning to further hurt our Country.

@realDonaldTrump	Advertising in the Failing New York Times is WAY down. Washington Post is not much better. I canâ€™t say whether this is because they are Fake News sources of information, to a level that few can understand, or the Virus is just plain beating them up. Fake News is bad for America!

@realDonaldTrump	The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric. We will be giving that a good look. Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on. Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation?

@realDonaldTrump	So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!
@realDonaldTrump	Governor @GavinNewsom of California has been very nice &  highly supportive about the great job we have done, working together, for California. That is the good news, but this is the bad. He is unfairly under attack by the Radical Left Dems, MSDNC etc. He is strong! Will he fold?
@realDonaldTrump	I will be watching. HAVE A GREAT EASTER! https://twitter.com/robertjeffress/status/1248418249856827395Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesnâ€™t have a clue on how to fight and win. Their views on Tariffs & Trade are losers for the U.S., but winners for other countries, including China. If we followed their standards,  weâ€™d have no Country left. They should love Sleepy Joe!
@realDonaldTrump	Watching @FoxNews on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time. We now have some great alternatives, like @OANN.
@realDonaldTrump	â€śThe President and the Federal Government are doing an excellent job.

@realDonaldTrump	....Does anyone ever notice how few quotes from an actual person are given nowadays by the Lamestream Media. Very seldom. The unnamed or anonymous sources are almost always FAKE NEWS.

@realDonaldTrump	Governors, get your states testing programs & apparatus perfected. Be ready, big things are happening. No excuses! The Federal Government is there to help. We are testing more than any country in the World. Also, gear up with Face Masks!
@realDonaldTrump	The Opposition Party (Lamestream Media) and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, have put their political game plan in full swing. â€śWhether he is right or wrong, it doesnâ€™t matter. Criticize â€™Trumpâ€™ for everything, and donâ€™t let the public see Biden. Hide him.â€ť
@realDonaldTrump	If the Fake News Opposition Party is pushing, with all their might, the fact that President Trump â€śignored early warnings about the threat,â€ť then why did Media & Dems viciously criticize me when I instituted a Travel Ban on China? They said â€śearly & not necessary.â€ť Corrupt Media!
@realDonaldTrump	Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe, Chris Wallace, on @FoxNews. I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press(please!), or the people over at Deface the Nation. What the hell is happening to @FoxNews. Itâ€™s a whole new ballgame over there!
@realDonaldTrump	The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. I just spoke to them from the Oval Office. Great deal for all!
@realDonaldTrump	For the first time in history there is a fully signed Presidential Disaster Declaration for all 50 States. We are winning, and will win, the war on the Invisible Enemy!
@realDonaldTrump	Great businessman & philanthropist Bernie Marcus, Co-Founder of Home Depot, said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating  CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!@dcexaminer

@realDonaldTrump	For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion, some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states, not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect....
@realDonaldTrump	....disaster, the Energy Industry will be strong again, far faster than currently anticipated. Thank you to all of those who worked with me on getting this very big business back on track, in particular Russia and Saudi Arabia.
@realDonaldTrump	Having been involved in the negotiations, to put it mildly, the number that OPEC+ is looking to cut is 20 Million Barrels a day, not the 10 Million that is generally being reported. If anything near this happens, and the World gets back to business from the Covid 19.....
@realDonaldTrump	The @nytimes story is a Fake, just like the â€śpaperâ€ť itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban, long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later, and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News!
@realDonaldTrump	I am working hard to expose the corruption and dishonesty in the Lamestream Media. That part is easy, the hard part is WHY?

@realDonaldTrump	China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S., not even close!
@realDonaldTrump	Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17,000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also, donâ€™t forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!

@realDonaldTrump	The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media, by far, is â€śsources sayâ€ť, or â€śofficials who spoke on the condition of anonymityâ€ť, or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesnâ€™t even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!
@realDonaldTrump	....them happy, or even a little bit satisfied. They were RUDE and NASTY. This is their political playbook, and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!
@realDonaldTrump	....Example! V.P. Mike Pence held a conference call yesterday with all Democrat Senators.

@realDonaldTrump	I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:45 P.M. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	Fully signed and ready to go! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252418369170501639Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Please study this closely. We saved many lives with our fast action on CoronaVirus! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252046878314770432Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	We did it once, we will quickly do it a second time! https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1253084269347561474Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to Harvard and all others! https://twitter.com/CLewandowski_/status/1253105147309445120Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	.@foxandfriends  We now have many Ventilators to spare. Thank you to all! https://twitter.com/Mike_Pence/status/1253123932280041473Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	I will never let our Post Office fail. It has been mismanaged for years, especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. The people that work there are great, and weâ€™re going to keep them happy, healthy, and well!
@realDonaldTrump	Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Ecuador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators, of which we have recently manufactured many, and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus!
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to President Juan Orlando Hernandez of the Republic of Honduras. We work closely together on the Southern Border. Will be helping him with his request for Ventilators and Testing.
@realDonaldTrump	Great News! Randall Stephenson, the CEO of heavily indebted AT&T, which owns and presides over Fake News @CNN, is leaving, or was forced out. Anyone who lets a garbage â€śnetworkâ€ť do and say the things that CNN does, should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!
@realDonaldTrump	I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas, beauty salons, tattoo parlors, & barber shops should take a little slower path, but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (& USA)!
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators, which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to my friend, President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators, which we will provide. Great cooperation between us!
@realDonaldTrump	Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!
@realDonaldTrump	The Fake and totally corrupt News is after her as a means of getting to me. Sheâ€™s smart and strong, knows the truth. Already a heroine to many! https://twitter.com/GOPChairwoman/status/1253495197805301762Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators, building hospitals, beds and yes, Testing, have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!
@realDonaldTrump	Important news! https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1253102278971666437Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Disgraceful. Should join the Republican Party! https://twitter.com/GOPChairwoman/status/1253495197805301762Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Remember, the Cure canâ€™t be worse than the problem itself. Be careful, be safe, use common sense!
@realDonaldTrump	What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately. They get record ratings, & the American people get nothing but Fake News. Not worth the time & effort!
@realDonaldTrump	Was just informed that the Fake News from the Thursday White House Press Conference had me speaking & asking questions of Dr. Deborah Birx. Wrong, I was speaking to our Laboratory expert, not Deborah, about sunlight etc. & the CoronaVirus. The Lamestream Media is corrupt & sick!
@realDonaldTrump	The Do Nothing Democrats are spending much of their money on Fake Ads. I never said that the CoronaVirus is a â€śHoaxâ€ť, I said that the Democrats, and the way they lied about it, are a Hoax. Also, it did start with â€śone person from Chinaâ€ť, and then grew, & will be a â€śMiracleâ€ť end!
@realDonaldTrump	Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators, and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!
@realDonaldTrump	Many testing sites are, and have been, open & available. Just passed 5 Million Tests, far more than any other country in the world. In fact, more than all other major countries combined! Donâ€™t believe the Fake News! https://twitter.com/CDCgov/status/1253768673338118144Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	.@TripleH is a total winner! https://twitter.com/VinceMcMahon/status/1253768179517657088Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you to William Perry Pendley of the Bureau of Land Management. Great job on @TuckerCarlson describing some of the most beautiful land in the world! @FoxNews
@realDonaldTrump	Does anybody get the meaning of what a so-called Noble (not Nobel) Prize is, especially as it pertains to Reporters and Journalists? Noble is defined as, â€śhaving or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals.â€ť Does sarcasm ever work?
@realDonaldTrump	Reports that H.H.S. Secretary @AlexAzar is going to be â€śfiredâ€ť by me are Fake News. The Lamestream Media knows this, but they are desperate to create the perception of chaos & havoc in the minds of the public. They never even called to ask. Alex is doing an excellent job!
@realDonaldTrump	....fraud @donnabrazile (and others who are even worse). Chris Wallace is nastier to Republicans than even Deface the Nation or Sleepy Eyes. The people who are watching @FoxNews, in record numbers (thank you President Trump), are angry. They want an alternative now. So do I!
@realDonaldTrump	....Even the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats laughed at the Fox suggestion. No respect for the people running @FoxNews. But Fox keeps on plugging to try and become politically correct. They put RINO Paul Ryan on their Board. They hire â€śdebate questions to Crooked Hillaryâ€ť....
@realDonaldTrump	.@FoxNews just doesnâ€™t get whatâ€™s happening! They are being fed Democrat talking points, and they play them without hesitation or research. They forgot that Fake News @CNN & MSDNC wouldnâ€™t let @FoxNews participate, even a little bit, in the poor ratings Democrat Debates.....
@realDonaldTrump	....schedule and eating habits, written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me. I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night & read & see that I am angrily eating a hamburger & Diet Coke in my bedroom. People with me are always stunned. Anything to demean!
@realDonaldTrump	I work from early in the morning until late at night, havenâ€™t left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals, Military Rebuilding etc., and then I read a phony story in the failing @nytimes about my work....
@realDonaldTrump	The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am  the hardest working President in history. I donâ€™t know about that, but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!
@realDonaldTrump	.@CardinalDolan  Thank you for a great call yesterday with Catholic Leaders, and a great Service today from @StPatsNYC!
@realDonaldTrump	Happy Birthday to Melania, our great First Lady!
@realDonaldTrump	Had a great call with Catholic Leaders and Educators earlier today. I will be online tomorrow at 10:15 A.M. (Eastern) for Sunday Mass celebrated by @CardinalDolan at St. Patrickâ€™s Cathedral (@StPatsNYC) in New York City. Join me:  https://saintpatrickscathedral.org/liveÂ  pic.twitter.com/iQy5iH5Lk6
@realDonaldTrump	I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
@realDonaldTrump	Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything, but just asking?
@realDonaldTrump	FAKE NEWS, THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
@realDonaldTrump	There has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!
@realDonaldTrump	Blame the Democrats for any â€ślatenessâ€ť in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. I wanted the money to be paid directly, they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. I told them this would happen, especially with many states which have old computers.
@realDonaldTrump	So true! https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1254172638307586049Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	American citizens! We were long ahead of Dems, who were all against the BAN. https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1254409196998725633Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Great! https://twitter.com/kayajones/status/1254399408009068544Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	They are one of the worst in the â€śnewsâ€ť business. Total slime balls! https://twitter.com/PressSec/status/1254460454971342854Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	They asked me to be at West Point on June 13th., & I will be there! https://twitter.com/davidjurban/status/1254476433667297282Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Laura, just another Fake News Report! https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle/status/1254539514699304960Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Thank you @BlueAngels and @AFThunderbirds! #AmericaStrong  https://twitter.com/BlueAngels/status/1255144203849326594Â â€¦ pic.twitter.com/bq0VOKYsmd
@realDonaldTrump	But I love Diamond & Silk, and so do millions of people! https://twitter.com/diamondandsilk/status/1254951865831370753Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Texas to open businesses in phases beginning Friday. Great job being done by @GregAbbott_TX
@realDonaldTrump	Many States moving to SAFELY & QUICKLY reopen!
@realDonaldTrump	We are doing far more, and better, Testing than any other country in the world, and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done, the same as with the Ventilators, they will never say we are doing a great job, they will only viciously gripe!
@realDonaldTrump	Because Shifty is a crooked politician! https://twitter.com/Jim_Jordan/status/1254774339527835650Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	No, I think Amash would make a wonderful candidate, especially since he is way behind in his district and has no chance of maintaining his Congressional seat. He almost always votes for the Do Nothing Dems anyway. I like him even more than Jill Stein! https://twitter.com/TheRickWilson/status/1255485246054809608Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	THANK YOU @MarkLevinShow! pic.twitter.com/GJSNM0LUQH
@realDonaldTrump	At least they admit it. The Failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost never correct their Fake Reporting! https://twitter.com/maxwelltani/status/1255161727706116096Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	The only reason the U.S. has reported one million cases of CoronaVirus is that our Testing is sooo much better than any other country in the World. Other countries are way behind us in Testing, and therefore show far fewer cases!
@realDonaldTrump	THANK YOU MICHAEL! @bittyandbeaus pic.twitter.com/KVXVcdO79E
@realDonaldTrump	Over 120 MILLION Economic Impact Payments have already gone out to hardworking Americans! If you havenâ€™t yet received your payment, go to  http://IRS.govÂ  and click on â€śGET MY PAYMENTâ€ť to receive your money FAST!
@realDonaldTrump	We canâ€™t let the Fake News, and their partner, the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, get away with stealing the Election. They tried that in 2016. How did that work out?
@realDonaldTrump	The Do Nothing Democrats! https://twitter.com/gopleader/status/1255553758253256704Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	FAKE NEWS! https://twitter.com/@realDonaldTrump/status/1255706636972363776Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Great! https://twitter.com/genflynn/status/1255645641105182722Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	DIRTY COP JAMES COMEY GOT CAUGHT!
@realDonaldTrump	Plus many! https://twitter.com/tomfitton/status/1255676634721632256Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	Really? Have you looked at the numbers lately! https://twitter.com/mitchellvii/status/1255798948461187073Â â€¦
@realDonaldTrump	FAKE POLLING, just like 2016 (but worse)!
@realDonaldTrump	What happened to General Michael Flynn, a war hero, should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!
@realDonaldTrump	Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone, a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News @CNN closely in toe), was treated fairly. How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred & bias. Same scammers as General Flynn!
@realDonaldTrump	Despite reports to the contrary, Sweden is paying heavily for its decision not to lockdown. As of today, 2462 people have died there, a much higher number than the neighboring countries of Norway (207), Finland (206) or Denmark (443). The United States made the correct decision!
@realDonaldTrump	Lyinâ€™ Brian Williams of MSDNC! pic.twitter.com/3gtkdmoZjJ
@realDonaldTrump	I must admit that Lyinâ€™ Brian Williams is, while dumber than hell, quite a bit smarter than Fake News @CNN â€śanchormanâ€ť Don Lemon, the â€śdumbest man on televisionâ€ť. Then you have Psycho Joe â€śWhat Ever Happened To Your Girlfriend?â€ť Scarborough, another of the low I.Q. individuals!
@realDonaldTrump	Lyinâ€™ Brian Williams of MSDNC, a Concast Scam Company, wouldnâ€™t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. Heâ€™s a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!
@realDonaldTrump	Just told that Fake News @CNN is falsely reporting that I was recently shouting at my campaign manager over made up nonsense. Actually, he is doing a great job, I never shouted at him (been with me for years, including the 2016 win), & have no intention to do so. Just FAKE NEWS!
@realDonaldTrump	.@CNN doesnâ€™t want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn & why they got the story so wrong. They, along with others, should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man & his family. They wonâ€™t even cover the big breaking news about this scam!
@realDonaldTrump	Happy Birthday to three time Olympian and five term Congressman, @JimRyun!
